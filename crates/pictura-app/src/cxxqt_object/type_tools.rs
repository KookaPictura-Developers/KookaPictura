//! `PictureView` declaration list does not grow).
//!
//! While text is being typed the canvas shows `type_preview_*` — the engine's
//! own render, so the preview is the commit — and nothing touches the document
//! or history. `type_commit_layer` adds one type layer and records one
//! "Horizontal Type" / "Vertical Type" state; `type_commit_mask` merges the
//! type's coverage into the selection and records one "Horizontal Type Mask" /
//! "Vertical Type Mask" state. Clicking an existing type layer reopens it:
//! `type_edit_begin` hides it (no state) while its text is retyped over it,
//! `type_commit_edit` re-sets it in place as one "Edit Type Layer" state, and
//! `type_edit_cancel` shows it again unchanged.
