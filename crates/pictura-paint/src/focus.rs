//! The focus tools' engine, **Blur** and **Sharpen**
//! (`docs/03-tools/smudge-blur-sharpen.md`): one tool with its sign flipped.
//! Both read a pixel's 3×3 neighbourhood; Blur moves the pixel *toward* the
//! neighbourhood's average, Sharpen pushes it as far the other way.
//!
//! Not the Blur and Sharpen *filters*: those are one pass over a whole layer.
//! These are brushes that work only where the tip passes, and **the more it
//! passes the stronger the effect gets** — each dab works on what the last one
//! left, so like the Mixer Brush they apply per dab straight into the layer.
//!
//! The kernel is a fixed 3×3 Gaussian: a bigger tip works a wider area by the
//! same amount per dab, and depth comes from working the same spot. A radius
//! that grew with the tip would turn one click of a large brush into a smear.
//!
//! Ported from photorust's `core/src/focus.rs`
//! (<https://github.com/perfecto25/photorust>). Behavioural parity only:
//! Adobe's kernels are closed.
