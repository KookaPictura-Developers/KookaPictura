//! The Red Eye tool: take the red out of a flash reflection inside a dragged
//! box. Only pixels where red genuinely dominates are touched, so the box can
//! be dragged loosely over an eye without draining the skin around it.
//!
//! Behavioural parity only: CS6's detector is closed; this is photorust's
//! red-dominance test (`docs/03-tools/healing-brushes.md` lists the tool in
//! the `J` group without an algorithm).
//!
//! Ported from photorust's `core/src/healing.rs` (`red_eye_region`)
//! (<https://github.com/perfecto25/photorust>).
