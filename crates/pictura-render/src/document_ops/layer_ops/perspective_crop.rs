//! Perspective Crop: map a user-marked quadrilateral (something that should be
//! rectangular but was photographed at an angle) onto a rectangle, straightening
//! and cropping in one step. Every layer, mask, and extra channel is warped
//! through the same homography, so the stack stays in register.
//!
//! Ported from photorust's `core/src/perspective.rs` and
//! `Document::perspective_crop` (<https://github.com/perfecto25/photorust>); the
//! homography solve and bilinear sampler are Kooka's own (`transform.rs`).
