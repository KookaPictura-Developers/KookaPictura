//! M27: apply `pictura_filters::Filter` kernels as wgpu compute passes.
//!
//! [`apply_filter_active`] runs a pointwise / separable-convolution filter on
//! the GPU when `gpu_enabled` is set and a usable adapter exists; otherwise it
//! delegates to the CPU oracle [`pictura_filters::apply`]. The accelerated set
//! is Gaussian Blur, Box Blur, Motion Blur, Blur, Blur More, Sharpen, Sharpen
//! More, Unsharp Mask, High Pass, Surface Blur, Maximum, Minimum, Median,
//! Custom (5×5) and Oil Paint. Any other filter (or any GPU failure) falls back
//! to the CPU with a byte-identical result and [`Backend::Cpu`].
//!
//! One WGSL compute shader carries every kernel behind a mode selector and a
//! normalized weight buffer:
//!
//! - `KERNEL` — a KxK convolution (Sharpen family; Blur, repeated for Blur
//!   More) with one rounded 8-bit write per pass;
//! - `SEP_H`/`SEP_V` — a separable 1-D convolution keeping an unrounded `f32`
//!   intermediate between the row and column passes, exactly like
//!   `pictura_filters::kernel::gaussian_blur_planes` (Gaussian, Box);
//! - `MOTION` — the directional 1-D sum (Motion Blur);
//! - `COMBINE` — a pointwise mix of the original and a blurred copy (Unsharp
//!   Mask, High Pass);
//! - `MEDIAN` — an exact per-channel order statistic over the clamped
//!   `(2r+1)²` window, selected by binary search on the byte value (the window
//!   count is always odd, so the middle element is unique and matches the CPU
//!   sort bit-for-bit).
//!
//! Samples are uploaded planar 8-bit, packed four bytes per `u32` word with the
//! same byte helpers as [`crate::gpu`]; one invocation owns a whole word, so
//! the read-modify-write of a shared word never races. Alpha is never uploaded
//! and never written back, so a 4-channel buffer keeps its alpha bit-for-bit.
//!
//! This module reuses the compositor's cached [`crate::gpu::shared_device`]
//! rather than opening a second Vulkan device, so filters and compositing share
//! one queue and one set of cached pipelines. The multi-pass stages each submit
//! separately (queue order is the barrier), which is fine while per-call setup
//! dominates; batch the encoder if filter dispatch ever shows up in a profile.
