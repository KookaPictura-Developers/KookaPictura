//! Clipping groups for the CPU compositor. A clipped layer (`Layer::clipping`)
//! with a non-clipped sibling below it in the same list (its base) shows only
//! where the base has content, and the group takes on the base's opacity and
//! blend mode, as CS6 documents ("the layers in a clipping mask take on the
//! opacity and mode attributes of the bottommost layer"). A clipped layer at
//! the bottom of its list has no base and composites unclipped.
//!
//! The group renders in isolation: the base at full opacity, then each clipped
//! layer composited onto a copy and blended back in by the base's coverage
//! (exact for every blend mode linear in the layer's coverage, all but
//! Dissolve); the result composites onto the backdrop with the base's opacity
//! and mode. The coverage is the base's content alone: its Fill opacity and its
//! effects do not narrow it, so a base at Fill 0 still clips.
//!
//! ponytail: isolating the group means a clipped layer's blend mode sees only
//! the base and the clipped layers below it, not the backdrop under the base.
