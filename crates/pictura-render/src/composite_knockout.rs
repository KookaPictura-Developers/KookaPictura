//! Knockout entry points and base threading for the CPU compositor.
//!
//! Split out of `composite.rs` (which sits at its file-size ceiling) so the
//! two-base selection lives next to the knockout helpers. `composite.rs` owns
//! the per-layer dispatch ([`composite_layer_inner`]) and the canvas model.
//!
//! A layer with a knockout composites against a base rather than the running
//! backdrop. The base depends on the mode: `Deep` reaches the document
//! background, inherited across pass-through groups and reset at an isolation
//! boundary; `Shallow` stops at the initial backdrop of the compositor applying
//! the layer (the enclosing group's entry backdrop).
