/// Filter ▸ Sharpen ▸ Sharpen Edges: sharpen where there is an edge and leave
/// everything else alone.
///
/// Plain Sharpen treats a patch of film grain in a flat sky exactly like the
/// boundary of a petal, and crisping the grain is not what anybody wanted.
/// This weighs each pixel's sharpening by how much of an edge is actually
/// there, so flat areas come through untouched and can therefore take a
/// heavier hand where it counts.
///
/// The edge is measured on the *blurred* copy rather than the original, so
/// that noise — which is by definition what a blur removes — does not read as
/// an edge and invite the sharpening it was meant to escape.
