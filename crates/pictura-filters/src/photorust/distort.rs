//! Geometric distortions — Filter ▸ Distort.
//!
//! These are a different shape of operation from the convolutions next door.
//! A blur asks "what is around this pixel"; a distortion asks "where did this
//! pixel come from", moves the whole picture about, and reads the source at a
//! position that almost never lands on a whole pixel. So they all share one
//! back end, [`remap`], and differ only in the function that answers that
//! question.
//!
//! Working backwards — for each destination pixel, find its source — rather
//! than forwards is what keeps the result free of holes. Pushing pixels
//! outwards leaves gaps between them wherever the distortion stretches.
