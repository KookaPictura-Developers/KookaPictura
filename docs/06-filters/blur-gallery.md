# Blur Gallery (Photographic Blur Gallery)

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-092`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Blur Gallery shipped in CS6 Standard and Extended. **GPU/OpenCL-gated**: the three CS6 effects are OpenCL-accelerated and the Help's GPU FAQ ties them to an OpenCL-capable card.
- **New in CS6:** `Yes` — CS6 introduces the **Blur Gallery** workspace with **Field Blur, Iris Blur, and Tilt-Shift** and a **Blur Effects** panel (Light Bokeh, Bokeh Color, Light Range). CS6's own Help and launch videos describe a **three-effect** gallery. **Path Blur, Spin Blur, Motion Blur Effects, Noise, and Edge Glow are post-CS6 (CC) additions** — see the clearly-marked subsection under `## CS6 behavior`. Smart-filter support is also CC-only.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `FILT-010` blur-filters (shares the blur-kernel vocabulary), `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-003` qt6-ui-design, `ARCH-007` color-management, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `LAY-021` smart-filters, `LAY-020` smart-objects, `IMG-005` bit-depth-and-conversion.

> All module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's blur shaders are closed; the algorithm description is **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Facts come from the fetched CS6 Help PDF and the fetched **CS6-era** Adobe Help snapshot unless marked *(inferred)* or explicitly labelled **post-CS6**.

## CS6 behavior

`Filter > Blur` then **Field Blur**, **Iris Blur**, or **Tilt-Shift**. The Help (both the PDF and the CS6-era Help page) is explicit that the gallery offers three distinct photographic blur effects and lists only those three. The workspace gives a **full-size, live preview** with **on-image overlay controls** (pins, handles, lines) instead of a modal slider-only dialog. Each blur can be applied alone or combined with the others.

Common CS6 workspace behaviour:

- **Pins.** A pin marks a blur location. Click the image to add pins; drag a pin to move it; press **Delete** to remove the selected pin. For Field Blur the final result is the **combined effect of all pins**; a pin may be placed **outside the image** to blur corners.
- **Blur handle / Blur Tools panel.** Drag the blur handle to increase/decrease the blur, or type a value in the **Blur Tools** panel.
- **Mask view (`M`).** Temporarily shows the blur mask: **dark = sharp, light = blurred**.
- **Hide UI (`H`).** Temporarily hides the on-canvas UI.

### Field Blur (CS6)

Builds a **gradient of blurs** by placing **multiple pins, each with its own blur amount**; the final result is the combined field of all pins. Useful for a graduated depth-of-field across several regions.

### Iris Blur (CS6)

Simulates a **shallow depth-of-field** independent of camera/lens. The default pin carries an ellipse with **A. sharp area, B. fade area, C. blur area**; drag the handles to redefine the areas and the blur handle to change amount. Multiple focus points (multiple pins) are supported — an effect the Help calls almost impossible with traditional camera technique.

### Tilt-Shift (CS6)

Simulates a **tilt-shift lens**: a band of sharpness then a fade to blur at the edges, used for a "miniature" look. Areas are **A. sharp, B. fade, C. blur**. Drag the lines to move them, drag the handles to rotate; multiple pins are allowed.

### Blur Effects panel (CS6 — only these three)

The Blur Effects panel takes a value for each of:

| CS6 Blur Effects control | Meaning (CS6 Help) |
|---|---|
| **Light Bokeh** | Brightens the out-of-focus/blurred areas. |
| **Bokeh Color** | Adds more vivid colour to lightened areas that are **not blown out to white**. |
| **Light Range** | Determines the range of tones affected by the Bokeh settings. |

### Post-CS6 additions — NOT CS6 parity

The task brief names Path Blur, Spin Blur, and "noise/color/edge glow" blur effects. The fetched CS6 sources contain **none** of these; they are **later Creative Cloud** additions. Recorded here so the boundary is explicit:

- **Path Blur** *(CC)* — motion blur along one or more drawn paths; overlay path with endpoints; controls include **Speed** (applied to all path blurs) and **Taper** (blur trails off gradually), a **Basic Blur / Rear Sync Flash** choice (Rear Sync Flash simulates a flash fired at the end of the exposure), and per-endpoint **End Point Speed**. *(Secondary source: Adobe Help snapshot, CreativePro.)*
- **Spin Blur** *(CC)* — radial blur around one or more points, measured in **Blur Angle 0–360°**, with an ellipse of centre points; supports **Strobe Strength**, **Strobe Flashes**, and **Strobe Flash Duration** (motion effects). *(Secondary source: Adobe Help snapshot, PCWorld.)*
- **Motion Blur Effects** *(CC)* — apply only to Path and Spin blurs (there must be a motion path/radius).
- **Noise effects** *(CC/later)* — add grain/texture back into blurred areas: reported controls include noise amount, size, roughness, colour, and highlights; a **Noise Distribution** (Uniform/Gaussian) and **Monochromatic** option are reported in later builds. Not found in CS6 sources.
- **Edge Glow** *(later; not found in CS6 sources)* — reported as a Blur Effects tab in modern Photoshop. Do **not** implement it as CS6 parity without a CS6 source; see `## Open questions`.
- **Smart filter support** — the photographic blur effects became Smart-Filter-capable **only in CC** ("Applying Blur gallery effects as smart filters | Creative Cloud only"). CS6 applies them **destructively**.

## Parameters & ranges

CS6 Help does **not** publish numeric ranges for the CS6 controls; the entries below marked *(unverified)* require a CS6 capture or a calibration experiment. Post-CS6 controls are listed separately and are not CS6 parity.

## Algorithms & pipeline

Behavioral parity only; Adobe's shaders are closed. Independent testing reported the gallery filters **require OpenCL 1.1** (see `## Sources`).

**Blur field construction** *(inferred)*. The gallery behaves like a depth-of-field renderer driven by a synthetic depth/weight field built from the placed pins, rather than a single uniform blur:

```text
# weights per pixel from pins (Field: multiple values; Iris/Tilt-Shift: region shapes)
for each pixel p:
    w(p) = combine_pin_weights(p, pins)         # e.g. inverse-distance / radial basis
    r(p) = lerp(r_min, r_max, w(p))             # blur radius
    out(p) = variable_radius_blur(src, p, r(p))
```

- **Field Blur** — `w` is an interpolation (inverse-distance / radial-basis-like) over the pin values, giving a smooth blur *gradient*; pins outside the image anchor the field at the borders.
- **Iris Blur** — the ellipse defines a **sharp** core, an annular **fade**, and a **blur** exterior; multiple pins generate multiple in-focus islands.
- **Tilt-Shift** — a band (two parallel lines) is sharp, with a symmetric fade to blur outside it; handle rotation sets the band angle.
- **Variable-radius blur / bokeh** *(inferred)* — a variable-radius blur, typically a disc/polygonal-kernel convolution for bokeh character rather than a pure Gaussian, so out-of-focus highlights stay "round" and bright.

**Blur Effects** *(inferred)*:

- **Light Bokeh** lifts luminance in blurred regions proportional to their brightness (an additive/highlight boost).
- **Bokeh Color** saturates lightened, non-clipped regions, roughly by increasing chroma in the bright/non-white range.
- **Light Range** gates both above to a tonal window (similar in spirit to a weight by luminance), so only a chosen band of tones is affected.

**Mask view (`M`)** renders the normalized field `w` as a grayscale overlay (dark = sharp, light = blurred) to explain exactly what the live blur is doing.

**GPU/OpenCL.** The GPU FAQ lists the gallery effects (under the labels scene blur, aperture blur, and tilt/offset) as **OpenCL-accelerated**; the CS6 beta notes call them accelerated by an OpenCL-compatible video card, and independent testing found the gallery needs **OpenCL 1.1**. Unlike Oil Paint, the gallery is listed as accelerated rather than "requires a compatible card"; a CPU fallback is the safe Linux default (see `## Open questions`).

## Rust module mapping

Proposals. The gallery is a GPU variable-blur pipeline with a small, serializable parameter set and an interactive overlay model.

- `pictura_filters::blur_gallery` — `BlurGalleryKind { Field, Iris, TiltShift }`, `BlurGalleryParams { pins: Vec<Pin>, bokeh: BokehParams, kind }`, `fn apply(&Document, Rect, &BlurGalleryParams, &mut Backend) -> FilterResult`.
- `pictura_filters::blur_gallery::field` — `fn build_weight_field(pins, kind, image_size) -> MaskBuffer`; interpolation kernel; pin-outside-image handling.
- `pictura_filters::blur_gallery::bokeh` — `struct BokehParams { light_bokeh: f32, bokeh_color: f32, light_range: (f32, f32) }`; highlight-lift and chroma post-pass.
- `pictura_filters::blur_gallery::kernels` — variable-radius disc/polygonal convolution; separable fast path where approximate.
- `pictura_render::blur_gallery` — `wgpu`/compute implementation; capability probe for OpenCL-class compute; CPU reference path.
- `pictura_filters::overlay` — geometry + hit-testing for pins, ellipse handles, and tilt-shift lines, shared with the Qt overlay.

Crossing types: `Pin { pos: Vec2f, blur: f32, kind_specific }`, `BokehParams`, `MaskBuffer`, `FilterResult`.

## Qt6 component mapping

The gallery is **canvas-centric and interactive**, so this is the one filter family where a QML overlay over a `QRhiWidget` preview is the better fit than a plain `QDialog`.

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `BlurGalleryWorkspace` | `QWidget`/`QRhiWidget` host | Full-size live preview + overlay; `H` hide-UI, `M` mask |
| `BlurGalleryOverlay.qml` | QML `Item` over the preview | Pins, iris ellipse + handles, tilt-shift lines; drag/add/delete |
| `BlurToolsPanel` | `QWidget`/QML panel | Numeric blur amount for the selected pin/effect |
| `BlurEffectsPanel` | `QWidget`/QML panel | CS6: Light Bokeh, Bokeh Color, Light Range |
| `PinModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | Pin list (position, blur, selection) shared with the overlay |
| `BlurGalleryDialog` | `QDialog` | Hosts the workspace for modal invocation; OK/Cancel/Fade |

Rationale: on-image editing with many hit-testable handles and a live GPU preview is exactly the interactive-canvas problem QML solves well; the existing app frame already embeds QML for canvas overlays (`ARCH-003`).

## Data-model impact

- **Destructive in CS6.** Applying from the Filter menu commits pixels to the active layer; one history state per commit; `Cancel` is a no-op.
- **Smart filters (CC only).** In CC the gallery is a smart filter; CS6 is not. Design the filter record to hold `BlurGalleryParams` (pin list + bokeh) so a smart-filter extension is possible (`LAY-021`).
- **No new document nodes.** The mask view is transient.
- **Serialization:** pin geometry and bokeh live in the filter `params_blob`; map to an XMP/PSD filter descriptor if smart-filter parity is pursued. The exact Adobe descriptor keys are unknown (see `## Open questions`).

## Edge cases

- **No supported GPU / missing OpenCL 1.1** — decide fallback: CPU path (safe Linux default) or gate the menu item. CS6 is GPU-accelerated; no confirmed hard requirement like Oil Paint.
- **8-bpc only?** — the CS6 16-/32-bpc filter lists exclude Field/Iris/Tilt-Shift, implying 8-bpc-only. Confirm; grey out on other depths if so.
- **Modes** — Bitmap/Indexed excluded; whether the gallery is RGB-only is unstated.
- **Pins outside the image** — Field Blur explicitly allows this to blur corners; the weight field must handle it.
- **Zero pins / deleted all pins** — treat as a no-op or re-seed one pin; do not crash.
- **Multiple pins** — Field combines all; Iris/Tilt-Shift compose multiple focus regions; the combine order must be deterministic.
- **Huge (PSB) documents** — full-size live preview is memory-heavy; use a downscaled preview while editing and render at full resolution on commit.
- **Selection** — confine processing to the selection (plus apron for the blur kernel).
- **Undo/redo** — one atomic state per OK.
- **Color management** — bokeh math (highlight lift, chroma) should be defined in the working space; Adobe's choice is undocumented.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a supported backend, Field Blur with N pins of equal amount produces a blur that increases from a pin toward the field midpoints and is monotonically related to per-pin amounts.
2. Given an Iris Blur pin, pixels inside the sharp ellipse are (within tolerance) unchanged, the fade annulus transitions smoothly, and the exterior is blurred; dragging handles moves the regions.
3. Given a Tilt-Shift band, pixels inside the sharp band are unchanged and blur increases with distance from the band; rotating the handles rotates the band.
4. Pressing `M` renders a mask consistent with the field (dark where sharp, light where blurred); `H` hides the overlay without changing the result.
5. Increasing **Light Bokeh** brightens blurred areas; increasing **Bokeh Color** raises chroma in lightened, non-clipped regions; **Light Range** restricts the effect to the selected tonal band.
6. Given a commit, exactly one history state appears and `Ctrl+Z` restores the pre-filter pixels bit-exactly.
7. Given a selection, pixels outside it are bit-identical.
8. On the CPU fallback, acceptance results match the GPU path within tolerance.
9. **CS6-boundary:** `Filter > Blur > Path Blur` and `Spin Blur` are **absent** in CS6-parity mode; if a CC-extension build adds them they are clearly labelled non-parity.

## Open questions

- **CS6 numeric ranges/defaults.** The CS6 Help gives no min/max/default for blur amount, ellipse geometry, or the three bokeh sliders. Resolves with: a CS6 dialog capture and a calibration experiment.
- **Was the CS6 Blur Gallery hard-gated on OpenCL?** Independent testing says OpenCL 1.1 is required; the GPU FAQ says "accelerated." Determine whether CS6 **refuses** to open the gallery without it or merely runs slowly. Resolves with: a CS6 test on a non-OpenCL machine.
- **8-bpc-only confirmation** for CS6 (inferred from the depth lists). Resolves with: a CS6 depth test.
- **`Edge Glow`.** Named in the task brief but **not found in any fetched CS6 source**; likely a later Blur Effects tab. Do not treat as CS6 parity until a CS6 source establishes it. Resolves with: an Adobe CS6-era Blur Effects screenshot or Help page.
- **Noise controls.** "Noise effects" are post-CS6; the exact modern control set (amount/size/roughness/colour/highlights, distribution, monochromatic) is from a secondary overview and varies by version. Resolves with: a version-specific Adobe Help page.
- **Bokeh algorithm.** Whether the blur kernel is a disc, polygon, or a shaped aperture, and how Light Bokeh/Color/Range map to math, is undocumented. Resolves with: reference-image fitting against CS6 output.
- **Smart-filter serialization.** Adobe's PSD filter-descriptor keys for pin geometry/bokeh are unknown. Resolves with: a PSD with a Blur Gallery smart filter, parsed.
- **Performance budget** for full-resolution preview and commit on large documents. Belongs to `01-architecture/performance-targets.md`.
