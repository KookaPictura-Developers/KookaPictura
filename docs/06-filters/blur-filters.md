# Blur Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-010`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Blur submenu is in CS6 Standard. The CS6 **Blur Gallery** (Field Blur, Iris Blur, Tilt-Shift) is a separate CS6 addition and is specified in `06-filters/blur-gallery.md`.
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — **Box Blur** and **Shape Blur** are part of the CS6 blur set, and the **Blur Gallery** is new (its on-canvas tools are not this spec). The classic Blur-submenu filters (Average, Blur, Blur More, Gaussian, Lens, Motion, Radial, Smart, Surface) predate CS6 and are unchanged.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `LAY-004` layer-masks, `IMG-009` 32-bit-hdr, `ARCH-007` color-management.

> All module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's exact kernels are closed; parity is **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. The CS6 Help describes each filter's controls and qualitative behavior; algorithm families below are drawn from standard image-processing references (fetched), not from Adobe source. Parameter ranges are *(inferred)* where the fetched primary source does not state them.

## CS6 behavior

Blur filters "soften a selection or an entire image" by  The Blur submenu:

- **Average** — finds the average color of the image or selection and fills it with that color, producing a smooth homogeneous patch.
- **Blur / Blur More** — eliminate noise at significant color transitions; Blur More's effect is **three or four times stronger** than Blur. Neither has a dialog.
- **Box Blur** — blurs using the average color of neighboring pixels; the **radius** sets the size of the area averaged; a larger radius blurs more.
- **Gaussian Blur** — "quickly blurs a selection by an adjustable amount"; applies a bell-curve weighted average, adding low-frequency detail and producing a hazy effect.
- **Lens Blur** — adds depth-of-field blur controlled by a **depth map** (a selection, an alpha channel, or a layer mask); some objects stay in focus while others blur; the iris shape (number of blades, curvature, rotation) controls the bokeh character; specular highlights and re-injected noise are controllable.
- **Motion Blur** — blurs along a direction from **–360° to +360°** at an intensity from **1 to 999**, analogous to a fixed-exposure shot of a moving subject.
- **Radial Blur** — simulates zoom or rotation blur. **Spin** blurs along concentric circular lines (a degree of rotation); **Zoom** blurs along radial lines (a value **1 to 100**). **Quality** is **Draft / Good / Best** (Draft fast but grainy; Good and Best smooth, indistinguishable except on a large selection). **Blur Center** sets the origin.
- **Shape Blur** — uses a chosen custom-shape **kernel** preset; the **radius** sets kernel size, hence blur amount.
- **Smart Blur** — "blurs an image with precision." **Radius** = size of the area searched for dissimilar pixels; **Threshold** = how dissimilar pixels must be before they are affected. **Mode**: **Normal** (whole selection), **Edge Only** (black-and-white edges), **Overlay Edge** (white edge overlay). A **Quality** control exists.
- **Surface Blur** — blurs while preserving edges; **Radius** = area sampled; **Threshold** = how much neighboring pixels' tonal values must diverge from the center before being excluded from the blur. Useful for noise/grain removal.

**Selection-edge caveat (sourced):** Gaussian Blur, Box Blur, Motion Blur, and Shape Blur use image data from **outside the selected area**, so a background selection next to sharp foreground can pick up foreground color and produce a fuzzy, muddy outline. The Help recommends **Smart Blur or Lens Blur** in that situation.

**Blur Gallery** (Field/Iris/Tilt-Shift) is CS6-new and lives in its own workspace with on-image pins and Bokeh controls; it is out of scope here.

## Algorithms & pipeline

Adobe kernels are not published; the following are standard algorithm families that reproduce the documented behavior. All are proposed as **behavioral parity only**.

### Gaussian Blur — separable Gaussian convolution
- Convolve with a 2-D Gaussian; because the kernel is **separable**, implement as two 1-D passes (horizontal then vertical) with cost ≈ `O(2·N·r)` per tile.
- Discrete kernel radius ≈ `⌈3σ⌉` (contributions beyond 3σ are negligible); normalize the kernel so the sum is 1. `σ` is derived from the UI **radius** (Adobe's radius↔σ mapping is closed; propose `radius` as the 3σ support, i.e. `σ = radius/3`, and tune).
- Alternatives for large radii: three successive **box blurs** approximate a Gaussian, or an IIR/Deriche-style recursive filter; the FIR kernel is the correctness baseline.
- Reference: Wikipedia *Gaussian blur* (separable FIR, normalization, 3σ cutoff, box-blur/IIR alternatives).

### Box Blur — moving average
- Each output pixel = mean of a `(2r+1)²` neighborhood. Separable; can be computed in **O(1) per pixel** with a running sum (or a summed-area/integral image).
- Reference: Wikipedia *Box blur*.

### Motion Blur — 1-D line convolution
- Convolve along a line through the pixel at the given **Angle**, with length **Distance** (1–999) — a 1-D box (or linear-ramp) kernel. Non-separable in the general-angle case; sample along the line with supersampling to reduce aliasing (odd/even distance).
- Reference: Wikipedia *Motion blur* (direction + distance streaking).

### Radial Blur — polar resampling + angular/radial smearing
- **Spin:** convert to polar `(θ, r)`, take a 1-D moving average along `θ` over the rotation amount, resample back. Cost/quality = number of angular samples: Draft (few, grainy), Good, Best (many).
- **Zoom:** take a 1-D moving average along the radial direction (scale smear), then resample back. Amount 1–100 maps to the smear length.
- Both center on **Blur Center**; sample with interpolation.

### Surface Blur — bilateral filter
- Per-pixel weighted average where the weight is the product of a **spatial** Gaussian and a **range** (intensity-difference) kernel; the range term suppresses averaging across edges. The UI **Radius** maps to the spatial σ, **Threshold** to the range σ (or a hard intensity gate). Photoshop's Surface Blur is documented as a bilateral filter.
- Extensions/limitations: staircase and gradient-reversal artifacts of the direct form; a **guided filter** is a known faster alternative.
- Reference: Wikipedia *Bilateral filter* (definition, σd/σr, artifact list, explicit "Photoshop surface blur" note).

### Average — region mean
- Compute the mean color over the selection (or layer bounds) and fill; `O(N)`. For 32-bit, average in float and do not clamp to 1.0 (`IMG-009`).

### Lens Blur — depth-map-driven aperture convolution
- **Depth map** `d(x)` (0 = near/front, 255 = far) from selection/alpha/mask; `|d − focal|` selects the blur radius at each pixel (a "circle of confusion" ramp). Adobe documents focal distance semantics: with focal 100, pixels at 1 and 255 are fully blurred and pixels near 100 are blurred least; clicking the image sets focal distance.
- Blur with a **disc/iris-shaped** kernel whose shape is the aperture: number of blades → polygon; **Blade Curvature** rounds the polygon toward a circle; **Rotation** rotates it. This produces the characteristic bokeh (out-of-focus point lights repeat the aperture shape).
- **Specular highlights:** pixels brighter than **Specular Threshold** contribute extra brightness (additive highlight kernel), so out-of-focus highlights bloom rather than dim.
- **Noise:** re-inject Uniform or Gaussian grain (optionally Monochromatic) because blurring removes original grain.
- **Preview Faster/More Accurate** changes sampling density only.
- Reference: Wikipedia *Bokeh* (aperture-shaped out-of-focus blur).

### Smart Blur — edge-aware selective blur
- Detect significant color changes; blur only the non-edge pixels. The **Threshold** gates dissimilarity; **Radius** is the search window; **Mode** either blurs normally, draws black-and-white edge lines (**Edge Only**), or overlays white edges on the blurred result (**Overlay Edge**). Algorithm family: edge detection (gradient/threshold) + threshold-limited averaging; the exact Adobe edge kernel is closed.

### Shape Blur — kernel-shaped convolution
- Convolve with a binary/antialiased **custom shape** kernel (scaled by radius) instead of a disc/Gaussian. Family: arbitrary-kernel convolution, usually via summed-area table across a downsampled rotated/scaled shape.

### Blur / Blur More
- Fixed small **Gaussian-like 3×3 convolution**; Blur More is ~3–4× the strength of Blur (sourced). No controls.

### Shared pipeline
Apply through the `FILT-001` pipeline: target resolution → depth/mode gate → **apron** (blur kernels need `radius` of source outside the selection) → backend dispatch (GPU compute if ported, else `rayon` CPU) → tile iteration with progress/cancel → selection/mask composite → single undo commit. Color-managed docs convolve in the document working space; 32-bit float stays float.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed under `pictura-filters::blur` (`ARCH-002`, `ARCH-006`):

- `pictura-filters::blur::gaussian` — `GaussianBlur { radius }`; separable FIR (baseline), optional box-approx and IIR paths; `fn sigma_from_radius`.
- `pictura-filters::blur::box` — `BoxBlur { radius }`; running-sum separable implementation.
- `pictura-filters::blur::motion` — `MotionBlur { angle, distance }`; line kernel + supersampling.
- `pictura-filters::blur::radial` — `RadialBlur { method: Spin|Zoom, amount, quality, center }`; polar resampler + 1-D smear.
- `pictura-filters::blur::surface` — `SurfaceBlur { radius, threshold }`; bilateral filter.
- `pictura-filters::blur::average` — `Average`; region mean.
- `pictura-filters::blur::lens` — `LensBlur { source: DepthSource, focal, invert, iris: Iris, radius, specular, noise }`; disc/iris convolution, specular add, grain injection.
- `pictura-filters::blur::smart` — `SmartBlur { radius, threshold, quality, mode }`; edge-gated averaging.
- `pictura-filters::blur::shape` — `ShapeBlur { kernel: ShapeRef, radius }`.
- `pictura-filters::blur::simple` — fixed 3×3 Blur / Blur More.
- Shared: `pictura-filters::kernel::separability`, `Sampler` (bilinear), `apron`.

Types: `Radius(f32)`, `Angle(f32)`, `Iris`, `DepthSource`, `Quality`. Crossing `TileView` ROIs; no Qt types.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets, matching the CS6 modal dialogs; pixel work in Rust.

- `GaussianBlurDialog` — `QDoubleSpinBox` radius + preview.
- `MotionBlurDialog` — `QDial`/`QSpinBox` angle + `QSpinBox` distance.
- `RadialBlurDialog` — method `QComboBox`, amount spin, quality `QComboBox`, `BlurCenterWidget` (drag crosshair).
- `BoxBlurDialog` / `SurfaceBlurDialog` — radius (and threshold) controls.
- `SmartBlurDialog` — radius, threshold, quality, mode.
- `LensBlurDialog` — depth-source `QComboBox` (populated from document channels/masks), focal `QSlider`, iris `QComboBox`, curvature/rotation/radius/specular/noise controls, and a **depth-map preview** with click-to-set-focus.
- `BlurFilterPreview` (`QLabel`/`QImage`) — shared preview pane with +/- zoom and drag-to-pan; all dialogs embed it.
- `FilterProgressProxy` — shared cancelable progress.

## Data-model impact

- **No persistent fields** for destructive blur filters. Each apply is one `HistoryRecord::FilterOp { filter_id, roi, params_blob, before_tiles, after_hash }` (`ARCH-009`).
- **Lens Blur** reads an existing depth source (selection, alpha channel, layer mask) but does not create channels; it never mutates the source map.
- **Randomness:** Blur itself is deterministic. Lens Blur's re-injected noise is random; store the RNG **seed** in the record so redo is bit-exact (design choice).
- **Smart Object:** a blur applied to a Smart Object becomes a Smart Filter entry with `{ filter_id, params, blend, opacity, enabled }` (`LAY-021`); not baked.
- **Color/depth:** parameters are stored per filter; the 32-bit float path stores no LUT.

## Edge cases

- **Degenerate radius 0 / distance 1.** Identity or near-identity; still commit consistently (or refuse with no history state).
- **Selection edge.** Gaussian/Box/Motion/Shape sample the apron and may contaminate edges; Smart/Lens must not. Document per-kernel; tests must pin the chosen behavior.
- **Radius larger than the image/tile.** Clamp the kernel support to available source; use reflection/replication at image borders (propose **clamp-to-edge**, matching common Photoshop behavior; unverified).
- **1×1 and 1-px-wide documents.** Separable passes must handle zero-height/width; no panics.
- **Huge PSB documents.** Tile-local; no whole-image buffers; `⌈3σ⌉` support bounded by an apron and possibly multi-pass tiling for very large radii.
- **32-bit HDR.** Lens Blur and Gaussian must not clamp >1.0; Average keeps float precision.
- **CMYK / Lab / Grayscale / Multichannel.** Operate per channel in the document space; Lab radial/blur is fine, but any blend/fade afterward respects `FILT-001` Lab restrictions.
- **Lens Blur missing/invalid depth source.** Refuse with a clear message rather than blurring uniformly.
- **Lens Blur preview "Faster" must never be committed.** Only the final full-quality result is written.
- **GPU unavailable / device lost.** CPU path; identical results within tolerance.
- **Cancellation mid-apply.** Atomic no-op (no history state).
- **Undo/redo.** Bit-exact; randomness via stored seed.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a solid-color image, Gaussian, Box, and Blur are no-ops (within 1 LSB); given an edge, each produces a smooth transition whose width grows with radius.
2. Given the same radius, Gaussian Blur output matches a separable-Gaussian reference convolution within 2 LSB (8-bit) for `radius ≤ 50`, on both CPU and GPU paths.
3. Given Motion Blur at `angle = 0`, the streak is horizontal; at `angle = 90`, vertical; at `distance = 1`, the result is close to the original.
4. Given Radial Blur Zoom with a centered blur center, the image scales-smears radially; Spin with the same center smears rotationally; Draft is visibly grainier than Best for the same amount on a large image.
5. Given a step edge, Surface Blur with a small Threshold preserves the edge while smoothing flat regions; increasing Threshold smooths across the edge.
6. Given Average on a uniform region, the output is exactly the region mean; on a selection it affects only the selection.
7. Given a depth map that is black at the bottom and white at the top with focal distance 0, Lens Blur keeps the bottom sharp and blurs the top increasingly; clicking the image updates the focal distance and refocuses that depth. A point light well off-focus reproduces the chosen iris shape.
8. Given Smart Blur Mode `Edge Only`, the output is a black-and-white edge map; `Overlay Edge` overlays white edges on the blurred image; `Normal` blurs non-edge areas.
9. Given a selection adjacent to sharp foreground, Smart Blur and Lens Blur do not pick up foreground color at the selection edge, while Gaussian/Box/Motion/Shape may (documented behavior).
10. Given 32-bit HDR input, Gaussian Blur preserves values > 1.0 without clamping.
11. Given a blur apply, undo restores every touched pixel bit-exactly and adds exactly one history state; cancelling adds none.

## Open questions

- **Radius↔σ mapping for Gaussian Blur.** Adobe does not document how the UI radius maps to the Gaussian standard deviation. Resolve by measuring Photoshop's impulse response and fitting σ.
- **CS6 parameter ranges/defaults.** The fetched PDF gives ranges only for Motion Blur distance (1–999), Radial Zoom amount (1–100), and Dust & Scratches (elsewhere). All other ranges/defaults are *(inferred)* from modern Photoshop/community and need confirmation from a CS6 build or scripted dialog read.
- **Box Blur and Shape Blur 16-bit availability.** The CS6 16-bit list includes both; confirm the exact CS6-at-launch dot release. Shape Blur's shape-preset enumeration and default are unknown.
- **Radial Spin amount semantics.** Whether the Spin "amount" is literal degrees or a 1–100 scale is unclear; resolve with measurements.
- **Lens Blur iris definition.** Blade counts/presets, curvature mapping, and the specular-highlight compositing formula are closed. Resolve by matching out-of-focus point-light images.
- **Lens Blur noise distribution defaults.** Distribution and monochromatic defaults are unverified.
- **Border handling.** Whether Photoshop clamps, reflects, or wraps at image borders for each blur is untested. Resolve with edge-pixel probes.
- **Smart Blur edge kernel.** Exact edge detection and threshold application are closed; `Edge Only`/`Overlay Edge` output convention (black/white assignment) is known but the kernel is not. Behavioral parity.
- **Gaussian precision.** Whether CS6 computes 8-bit blur in 8-bit integer or in higher precision internally affects banding; resolve by gradient tests.
- **GPU port priority.** Which blur kernels must be GPU-accelerated to meet `ARCH-003` (Gaussian is the stated benchmark) is a design choice; the parity requirement is only that CPU results are correct.
