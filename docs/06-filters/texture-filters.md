# Texture Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-083`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Texture submenu and its Filter Gallery category are in CS6 Standard and Extended.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the 6 Texture filters are unchanged from CS5.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `LAY-021` smart-filters, `LAY-020` smart-objects, `FILT-080` artistic-filters (shared texture options), `IMG-005` bit-depth-and-conversion, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-003` performance-targets.

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's kernels are closed: **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Control names are taken from the CS6 Help PDF and Adobe Help; ranges marked *(sourced)* are from the fetched references in `## Sources`; unmarked defaults/ranges are *(inferred)* and must be confirmed against a CS6 build.

## CS6 behavior

**Texture filters.** The CS6 Help describes the Texture filters as simulating the appearance of depth or substance, or adding an organic look. They appear as the **Texture** category in the Filter Gallery (one of the six gallery categories: Artistic, Brush Strokes, Distort, Sketch, Stylize, Texture).

The family has **6** filters. All are **8-bit only** and run in the Filter Gallery.

| Filter | CS6 Help behavior (sourced) |
|---|---|
| **Craquelure** | Paints the image onto a high-relief plaster surface, producing a fine network of cracks that follow the image contours. Useful for embossing effects on broad-range color/grayscale images. |
| **Grain** | Adds texture by simulating different kinds of grain. Types: **Regular, Soft, Sprinkles, Clumped, Contrasty, Enlarged, Stippled, Horizontal, Vertical, Speckle** *(all 10 sourced from the CS6 PDF)*. The sprinkles and stippled types use the background color *(PSE Help)*. |
| **Mosaic Tiles** | Draws the image as if made of small chips/tiles with grout between them. (Distinct from `Pixelate > Mosaic`, which makes blocks of different-colored pixels.) |
| **Patchwork** | Breaks the image into squares filled with the predominant color, randomly raising/lowering tile depth to replicate highlights/shadows. |
| **Stained Glass** | Repaints the image as single-colored adjacent cells outlined in the foreground color. |
| **Texturizer** | Applies a selected or loaded texture (e.g. canvas, brick, or a glass-block look); the texture is lit/scaled/relief-adjusted. |

**Filter Gallery mechanics (shared).** One dialog: preview, category thumbnails, selected-effect options, applied-effect list. Effects are **cumulative and applied in list order**, **reorderable by drag**, **hideable with the eye icon**, **deletable**. The gallery is **8-bit-per-channel only**. On a Smart Object the stack becomes one grouped "Filter Gallery" entry (`LAY-021`). Shared keys, Fade, and pipeline are in `FILT-001`.

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Filter > Texture > <filter>` | menu submenu | — | Same filters also inside the Filter Gallery |
| `Filter > Filter Gallery > Texture` | dialog category | — | Cumulative stack; canonical CS6 route |
| Filter Gallery — filter thumbnail | click | `Alt`-click applies on top *(PDF)* | Adds the effect |
| Filter Gallery — options pane | controls | — | Per-filter sliders/combo |
| Filter Gallery — applied list | drag / eye / delete | — | Reorder, hide, delete |
| Filter Gallery — Cancel button | button | `Ctrl`→Default, `Alt`→Reset *(PDF)* | Button changes label |
| `Edit > Fade` | dialog | — *(shortcut unverified)* | Opacity + mode of the last effect |
| Layers panel — Smart Filters line | panel | — | Stack appears as one "Filter Gallery" entry |

## Parameters & ranges

All Texture filters run in **8-bit** only. Control names are from the CS6 Help PDF and Adobe/PSE Help; ranges are *(inferred)* from the CS6 dialog and community documentation unless marked *(sourced)* (the CS6 PDF publishes the **Grain Type** enumeration; `iezombie` names the controls).

## Algorithms & pipeline

All Texture kernels are closed; **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Shared application pipeline in `FILT-001`.

- **Gallery stack.** Each filter is an independent stage in `pictura-filters::gallery`, evaluated in list order on the 8-bit image.
- **Craquelure (behavioral model).** Help describes painting onto high-relief plaster with a crack network following contours: a plausible model is a **cellular/crack pattern generated from the image luminance as a height field**, then lit (emboss) so crack edges catch light. The exact crack generator is closed.
- **Mosaic Tiles.** A tiling grid with grout: possibly a jittered/irregular cell tessellation with averaged cell color and a grout band between cells; `Lighten Grout` lifts the grout luminance. Contrast with `FILT-084` Mosaic (square-block averaging) per the Help note.
- **Patchwork (behavioral model).** Square blocks filled with the predominant color; squares are raised/lowered in depth (relief) to create highlights/shadows — a per-square luminance offset plus optional bevel.
- **Stained Glass.** A cell segmentation (e.g. watershed/Voronoi-like) with each cell flat-filled by its average color and a foreground-colored border; `Cell Size` sets the segmentation scale and `Light Intensity` modulates cell luminance.
- **Grain.** An additive/multiplicative noise field with ten distinct spatial/temporal distributions (Regular, Soft, Sprinkles, Clumped, Contrasty, Enlarged, Stippled, Horizontal, Vertical, Speckle); Sprinkles/Stippled draw from the background color. Use a **seeded RNG** so redo is reproducible.
- **Texturizer.** Tiles a selected/loaded grayscale height map under the image and lights it (Scaling, Relief, Light Direction, Invert) — the same shared texture model as Rough Pastels/Underpainting (`FILT-080`) and Conté Crayon (`FILT-082`).
- **Memory/performance.** Stained Glass is named in the CS6 Help's performance tip (increase cell size to speed it up); the implementation must be tile-local with a bounded apron (`ARCH-003`).

## Rust module mapping

Proposed under `pictura-filters::texture` (`ARCH-002`), implementing the shared `Filter` trait (`FILT-001`):

- `pictura-filters::texture::craquelure` — `Craquelure { crack_spacing, crack_depth, crack_brightness }`.
- `pictura-filters::texture::grain` — `Grain { intensity, contrast, grain_type: GrainType }`; `enum GrainType { Regular, Soft, Sprinkles, Clumped, Contrasty, Enlarged, Stippled, Horizontal, Vertical, Speckle }`; seeded RNG.
- `pictura-filters::texture::mosaic_tiles` — `MosaicTiles { tile_size, grout_width, lighten_grout }`.
- `pictura-filters::texture::patchwork` — `Patchwork { square_size, relief }`.
- `pictura-filters::texture::stained_glass` — `StainedGlass { cell_size, border_thickness, light_intensity }`.
- `pictura-filters::texture::texturizer` — `Texturizer { texture: TextureOptions }` (reuses `FILT-080`).
- Shared helpers: `pictura-filters::kernel::relief`, `pictura-filters::kernel::tessellate` (cellular/Voronoi), `pictura-filters::kernel::noise::SeededRng`, `pictura-filters::kernel::tile_grid`.

Crossing types: `Rect`, `TileView`, `Rgba` (foreground/background), `GrainType`, `LightDir`, `TextureRef`, `Seed(u64)`. No Qt types.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets, matching the CS6 Filter Gallery; pixel work in Rust. Shared gallery/preview/progress widgets and `TextureOptionsPane` are in `FILT-001`/`FILT-080`.

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `TextureOptionsPane` | `QWidget` (`QStackedWidget` page) | Hosts the selected Texture filter's controls |
| `CraquelurePane` … `TexturizerPane` | `QWidget` | One pane per filter; sliders via `FilterSliderSpin` |
| `GrainTypeCombo` | `QComboBox` | The 10 grain types |
| `SharedTexturePane` | `QWidget` | Texture preset + Load Texture, Scaling, Relief, Light Direction, Invert (Texturizer) |
| `FilterGalleryDialog` | `QDialog` | Shared category list, thumbnails, options stack, applied list, preview (`FILT-001`) |

Panes are generated from each filter's parameter descriptor; `GrainTypeCombo` is the only family-specific control type.

## Data-model impact

- **Destructive apply:** no persistent field; one `HistoryRecord::FilterOp { filter_id, roi, params_blob, seed, before_tiles, after_hash }` per committed apply (`ARCH-009`); grain stores the `seed`.
- **Smart Object:** each Texture filter (or a gallery stack) becomes a Smart Filter entry `{ filter_id, params, blend, opacity, enabled }`; the stack is one grouped entry (`LAY-021`).
- **Loaded textures:** a Texturizer "Load Texture" file is referenced by the filter descriptor; embed or reference the texture bytes so a saved document is self-contained (design decision — embed, matching PSD behavior). No new document-model node.
- **Serialization:** descriptors are written through the Smart Filter/Filter Effects path (`LAY-021`); per-parameter `FXid`/`FEid` key mapping is **unsourced**.
- Undo granularity is one apply.

## Edge cases

- **Mode:** Texture filters target 8-bit RGB/Grayscale/Multichannel; CMYK/Lab support is per filter and must be capability-gated (never convert).
- **Depth:** 16-bit/32-bit are not in Adobe's filter depth lists → 8-bit only; disable/show warning at higher depth.
- **Foreground/background identity:** Grain (Sprinkles/Stippled), Stained Glass border, and Texturizer use fg/bg; fg == bg can flatten the result; no divide-by-zero.
- **Loaded texture size.** Texturizer must tile arbitrary texture sizes across the ROI without assuming the texture is larger than a tile; missing/corrupt texture file must refuse with a message, not crash.
- **Degenerate cell sizes.** Stained Glass cell size 2, Mosaic Tiles tile size 2, Patchwork square size 0 must not loop or produce empty cells.
- **Huge PSB:** tile-local; cellular segmentation must be computed per tile or on a downscaled proxy with seam handling; grain must be procedural per tile with a coordinate-derived seed (not a full-canvas buffer).
- **Cancellation:** atomic no-op (`ARCH-003`).
- **GPU:** CPU fallback must be correct; no kernel requires a GPU (`ARCH-006`).
- **Empty/locked layer:** no-op or refuse per `FILT-001`.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given an 8-bit RGB document, each of the 6 Texture filters appears under `Filter > Filter Gallery > Texture` and in `Filter > Texture`, opens its options, produces a non-empty effect, and adds exactly one history state.
2. Given a 16-bit/32-bit document, Texture filters are disabled or show the Smart Filter warning; applying is refused with no conversion.
3. Given two Texture filters in the gallery, reordering changes the result; hiding one removes its contribution.
4. Given `Grain`, each of the 10 Grain Types produces a distinct texture; Sprinkles/Stippled use the background color; results are reproducible from the stored seed.
5. Given `Craquelure`, Crack Spacing changes crack frequency, Crack Depth changes apparent crack depth, and Crack Brightness changes crack luminance.
6. Given `Mosaic Tiles`, Tile Size changes the chip grid, Grout Width changes the grout band, and Lighten Grout lifts grout luminance.
7. Given `Stained Glass`, Cell Size changes the cell scale (and larger cells render faster, matching the CS6 performance note); the border is drawn in the foreground color.
8. Given `Texturizer`, selecting a preset or loading a file changes the surface; Scaling scales it, Relief changes depth, Light Direction changes apparent illumination, and Invert flips it.
9. Given identical input, parameters, and seed, CPU and GPU paths agree within 1 LSB (8-bit) and redo is bit-exact.
10. Given a Smart Object, applying a Texture filter adds a Smart Filters entry, leaves the pixels unchanged, and reopening restores saved parameters.

- **Craquelure/Stained Glass `cell`/`crack` units and algorithms.** The exact crack generator and cell segmentation are closed; behavioral parity only. Resolve with reference renders.
- **Texturizer texture presets.** The exact built-in height maps (and whether "Load Texture" stores an embedded copy) are undocumented. Resolve against a CS6-authored PSD.
- **Patchwork "predominant color" statistic.** Whether the square fill is a mean, mode, or median of the block is unknown; Resolve with synthetic block tests.
