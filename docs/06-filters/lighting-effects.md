# Lighting Effects

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-103`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (the CS6 revamped workspace), subject to the GPU requirement. On Linux the Mercury GPU path is replaced by wgpu/QRhi; a CPU fallback must exist.
- **New in CS6:** `Yes` — **verified**. CS6 replaced the older Lighting Effects dialog with a new **64-bit "Lighting Effects gallery"** — a dedicated workspace with on-canvas controls and previews. The CS6 What's-New section states:  The CS6 Help corpus contains both a **`Add Lighting Effects (CS6)`** topic and a legacy **`Add Lighting Effects (CS5)`** topic; the difference is the workspace/UI, and the revamp is CS6 — **not** CC.
- **Depends on:** `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`, `01-architecture/document-model.md`, `01-architecture/undo-history.md`, `05-layers/smart-filters.md`, `07-color-painting/color-models.md`, `04-image-ops/image-modes.md`, `02-ui-ux/panels/channels-panel.md`

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF unless marked *(inferred)*. Adobe's lighting/reflection model is closed; those parts are **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**.

## CS6 behavior

`Filter > Render > Lighting Effects` produces lighting effects on **RGB images only**, optionally using grayscale texture channels (**bump maps**) to create 3D-like surface relief, and can save custom styles for reuse. **A supported video card is required** (PDF). The filter presents a dedicated workspace instead of a modal dialog.

**Workflow:**
1. Choose `Filter > Render > Lighting Effects`.
2. From the **Presets** menu (upper left), choose a style.
3. In the preview window, select a light; in the upper half of the **Properties** panel choose the light type (`Spot`, `Infinite`, or `Point`) and adjust **color**, **intensity**, and **hotspot size**. `Alt`/`Option`-drag a light to duplicate it.
4. In the lower half of the **Properties** panel adjust the whole rig: `Colorize`, `Exposure`, `Gloss`, `Metallic`, `Ambience`, and `Texture`.

**Lights:** at least one light is required; **only one light can be edited at a time**, but all added lights contribute. Up to **16 lights**. Add lights from the upper-left `Lights` icons; delete by dragging a light to the Trash icon in the **Lights** panel (lower right by default).

**Light types:**
- `Point` — shines in all directions from directly above, like a light bulb.
- `Infinite` — shines across an entire plane, like the sun.
- `Spot` — casts an elliptical beam; the line defines direction/angle and the handles define the ellipse.

**On-canvas adjustment:** Point — drag to move, drag the white arc of the Intensity ring to change spread. Infinite — drag the end handle to change direction, the Intensity ring to change brightness. Spot — drag inside the outer ellipse to move, beyond it to rotate, the inner ellipse edge to change the hotspot angle, the four outer handles to extend/shrink, and the Intensity ring to fill more/less of the ellipse. Intensity: 100 is brightest, ~50 is normal, negative removes light, −100 produces no light.

**Presets / styles:** the Presets menu offers **17 light styles** (the PDF enumerates 16 menu entries because `Five Lights Down/Five Lights Up` is one entry covering two directions). Documented styles: `2 o'clock Spotlight`, `Blue Omni`, `Circle Of Light`, `Crossing`, `Crossing Down`, `Default`, `Five Lights Down/Five Lights Up`, `Flashlight`, `Flood Light`, `Parallel Directional`, `RGB Lights`, `Soft Direct Lights`, `Soft Omni`, `Soft Spotlight`, `Three Down`, `Triple Spotlight`. The PDF lists representative intensity/focus values per style (e.g. `Default` = white spotlight, medium intensity 35, wide focus 69). Custom presets: choose `Custom`, add lights, click `Save`, name and confirm; saved presets include all per-light settings and appear in the Style menu for that image; `Delete` removes a preset.

**Texture channels (bump maps):** add a grayscale image as an alpha channel (or use the image's `Red`, `Green`, or `Blue` channel), then choose it from the `Texture` menu in the Properties panel and drag the **Height** slider from `Flat (0)` to `Mountainous (100)`. A white-on-black channel gives an embossed-text effect.

**Restriction:** Lighting Effects cannot be applied to a layer with no pixels (the PDF notes this for filters such as Lighting Effects).

## Algorithms & pipeline

*(inferred / behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD unless noted.)* Adobe's lighting model is closed; the following is the standard bump-map shading model consistent with the documented controls.

1. **Surface normals from a bump map** — the selected `Texture` channel is read as a height field; per-pixel normals are derived from its gradient, scaled by `Height`. With no texture, the surface is flat. *(inferred)*
2. **Per-light contribution** — for each light, compute the incident direction (Point: from a position; Infinite: a fixed direction; Spot: a position + axis + cone/ellipse and inner hotspot) and the diffuse term via `N·L`, attenuated by intensity (and for Spot, by the hotspot falloff). *(inferred)*
3. **Specular / material** — `Gloss` and `Metallic` parameterize a reflection lobe (glossier = tighter highlight; metallic shifts the balance between light and object reflectivity). The exact BRDF is closed. *(inferred)*
4. **Rig composition** — `Colorize` tints the overall lighting; `Exposure` maps the composed lighting; `Ambience` blends the light contribution with a uniform ambient term (100 = light only, −100 = ambient only). *(inferred)*
5. **Composite** — the shaded lighting is combined with the layer's image (typically a multiply/overlay-style combination on the image's color). The "3D-like preview" is a per-pixel shading result, **not** 3D geometry.

The **preview is GPU-composited** in CS6 (the 64-bit gallery). For this project the shading pass should run in wgpu/QRhi over a tiled image with a CPU fallback. Rendering must be deterministic so preview and commit agree.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_lighting::Light` — enum `Point { pos, intensity, color }`, `Spot { pos, axis, ellipse, hotspot, intensity, color }`, `Infinite { direction, intensity, color }`; on-canvas transform operations.
- `pictura_lighting::LightRig` — `Vec<Light>` (≤16), `Colorize`, `Exposure`, `Gloss`, `Metallic`, `Ambience`; `shade(&mut TileStore)`.
- `pictura_lighting::BumpMap` — height field from an alpha or color channel; `Height` scaling; normal derivation.
- `pictura_lighting::Preset` — named style = full light list + rig settings; load/save/delete; the style list.
- `pictura_lighting::gpu` — wgpu shading pass + CPU fallback; cache keyed by `(opaque, rig, texture_channel, backend)`.
- `pictura_filter::lighting_effects` — filter entry point; `supported(mode, depth)`; commits one history step; participates in the Smart Filter stack (`LAY-021`).

Crossing types: `LightId`, `Light`, `LightRig`, `ChannelRef`, `BumpMap`, `TileStore`, `Backend`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `LightingEffectsDialog` | `QDialog` (dedicated workspace) | Presets menu, Lights icons, Properties panel, Lights panel, OK/Cancel |
| `LightingCanvas` | `QQuickWidget`/`QRhiWidget` | Preview and on-canvas light handles (move/rotate/hotspot/intensity) |
| `LightHandles` | `QQuickItem` | Point/Infinite/Spot gizmos, `Alt`-drag duplicate |
| `LightingPropertiesPanel` | `QWidget`/`QStackedWidget` | Upper (type/color/intensity/hotspot) + lower (Colorize/Exposure/Gloss/Metallic/Ambience/Texture) |
| `LightsPanel` | `QListView` + `QAbstractListModel` | Light list, add/delete (drag to Trash) |
| `LightingPresetModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | 17 built-ins + user presets; Save/Delete |
| `TextureChannelSelector` | `QComboBox` + `HeightSlider` | Alpha/R/G/B channel + Flat…Mountainous |

Same widgets-vs-QML split as `FILT-102`: dense panels as Widgets, interactive canvas as QML/QtQuick for GPU-smooth handles.

## Data-model impact

- Non-destructive path: as a **Smart Filter** entry on a Smart Object; otherwise destructive on the raster layer. The `LightRig` (lights + rig settings + texture-channel reference + `Height`) is the serialized parameter set.
- **Presets/styles** are user data: built-in styles ship with the app; custom presets are saved (per the PDF they appear in the Style menu "whenever you open the image", suggesting image-level storage) and may also be stored in a preset library. Determine whether they live in the document or in preferences — see `## Open questions`.
- Texture references point at an alpha channel or the image's R/G/B channel; deleting/renaming the channel invalidates the reference and must be handled.
- Undo: the whole lighting session is one history step on commit; dialog edits re-render without history entries.
- No PSD key change beyond the generic filter/smart-filter serialization (`LAY-021`, `document-model.md`).

## Edge cases

- **RGB only** — CMYK, Lab, Grayscale, Bitmap, Indexed, Multichannel must be gated (PDF: "works only on RGB images").
- **Empty layer** — the filter cannot run on a layer with no pixels; disable/warn.
- **GPU required** — the CS6 filter requires a supported video card; on Linux define the wgpu path and a CPU fallback, with the warning if neither is available.
- **Bit depth** — Lighting Effects is not listed among the 16-bit or 32-bit capable filters in the CS6 Help; likely 8-bit-only. Verify and gate.
- **Texture channel missing** — if the selected channel is deleted or the document has no alpha channel, degrade to no bump map with a clear message.
- **16-light cap** — prevent adding a 17th light; the UI must reflect the limit.
- **Spot hotspot/extents** — degenerate hotspot (0/100) must not produce NaN normals or artifacts.
- **Negative intensity / Ambience extremes** — `−100` intensity and `±100` Ambience must be well-defined (no light / ambient only).
- **Colorize + per-light color interaction** — order of operations must match CS6 appearance.
- **Smart Filter** — verify Lighting Effects is allowed as a Smart Filter (it is not in the CS6 exclusion list of Extract/Liquify/Pattern Maker/Vanishing Point) and show the warning icon for unsupported mode/depth.
- **Large documents / PSB** — shade in tiles; avoid full-resolution float buffers.
- **Undo/redo** — Cancel restores exactly; OK is one reversible step.
- **Determinism** — on-canvas preview must match the committed render.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given an RGB image, `Filter > Render > Lighting Effects` opens the dedicated workspace (CS6 gallery), not the old modal dialog.
- Given `Default` preset, the visible light rig matches the documented style (white spotlight, medium intensity 35, wide focus 69) within tolerance.
- Given a `Point`/`Infinite`/`Spot` light, the on-canvas controls move/spread/rotate the light as described, and only one light is editable at a time while all lights contribute.
- Given 16 lights, a 17th cannot be added; deleting a light via the Lights panel removes its contribution.
- Given an alpha channel used as `Texture`, raising `Height` from 0 to 100 increases apparent relief monotonically.
- Given `Ambience = 100`, only the light source contributes; `Ambience = −100` removes it.
- Given `Colorize` on, the overall lighting is tinted.
- Given a CMYK/grayscale document, the filter is unavailable/gated; given a Smart Object with an unsupported mode/depth, the Smart Filter warning icon appears.
- Given an empty layer, the filter is disabled.
- Given `Save` of a custom preset, it appears in the Style menu for the image and reproduces the same rig.

## Sources

Fetched for this document:

- `https://help.adobe.com/archive/en/photoshop/cs6/photoshop_reference.pdf` — CS6 Help corpus (downloaded, `pdftotext -layout`). Established: the CS6 What's-New entry ; the coexistence of `Add Lighting Effects (CS6)` and `Add Lighting Effects (CS5)` topics; `Filter > Render > Lighting Effects`; RGB-only and supported-video-card requirement; the apply workflow; light types Point/Infinite/Spot and their on-canvas adjustments; intensity semantics (100 brightest, ~50 normal, negative removes, −100 none); the upper Properties controls (type, color, intensity, hotspot; `Alt`-drag duplicate) and lower rig controls (Colorize, Exposure, Gloss, Metallic, Ambience, Texture); 17 light styles and the enumerated names/representative values; max 16 lights, one edited at a time; add/delete via Lights panel; custom preset save/delete; bump-map texture channels (alpha or R/G/B) and `Height` Flat(0)–Mountainous(100); the note that Lighting Effects (among others) cannot be applied to layers with no pixels; the 16-/32-bit capable-filter lists (Lighting Effects absent).

Marked inferred/community (not primary): the bump-map normal/BRDF composition model, numeric bounds not in the PDF, the exact preview→commit pipeline, and the persistence location of custom presets.

## Open questions

- **Confirmed version.** The revamp is **CS6** per the CS6 What's-New and the `(CS6)`-labelled Help topic; cross-check any conflicting CC-era documentation during review.
- **GPU requirement vs fallback.** Does shipped CS6 refuse to run without a supported GPU, or fall back to CPU? Resolve with a build test; the project must define its own fallback.
- **Bit depth.** Confirm Lighting Effects is 8-bit-only (it is absent from the CS6 16-/32-bit capable lists). Resolve by testing 16-bit RGB in CS6.
- **Exact lighting model.** The diffuse/specular/ambient composition and `Gloss`/`Metallic` mapping are closed. Resolve with reference renders and tolerances, or accept behavioral parity only.
- **Preset count.** The PDF says 17 styles but enumerates 16 menu entries (one entry covers two directions). Confirm the canonical count and exact per-style parameters.
- **Preset storage.** Are custom presets stored in the image, a preset file, or preferences? The PDF says they "appear in the Style menu whenever you open the image". Resolve with a CS6 test.
- **Colorize semantics.** Whether `Colorize` multiplies, tints, or blends the rig, and its default color.
- **Smart Filter compatibility.** The exclusion list omits Lighting Effects; confirm it is smart-compatible and serializes as a generic filter effect.
- **Performance budget.** Interactive on-canvas lighting over a multi-megapixel image needs a latency target; define it in `01-architecture/performance-targets.md`.
- **Post-CS6 drift.** Exclude any CC-era Lighting Effects changes (if any) from parity.
