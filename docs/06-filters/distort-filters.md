# Distort Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-040`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (the geometric warp family) + `Extended-only` for **Lens Correction** (documented separately in `06-filters/lens-correction.md`)
- **New in CS6:** `Yes` — CS6 rebuilds **Lighting Effects** (render family) and adds **Adaptive Wide Angle**, but the Distort submenu itself is unchanged from CS5. **Lens Correction** gains the **Auto Correction** lens-profile workflow (CS5 had manual correction only).
- **Depends on:** `04-image-ops/bit-depth-and-conversion.md`, `01-architecture/color-management.md`, `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`, `01-architecture/document-model.md`, `05-layers/smart-filters.md`, `05-layers/blend-modes.md`, `06-filters/filters-overview.md`, `06-filters/lens-correction.md`, `06-filters/liquify.md`, `06-filters/adaptive-wide-angle.md`

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior and numeric ranges are taken from the fetched sources unless marked *(inferred)*. Adobe's exact resampling kernels and noise generators are closed; those are marked **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**.

## CS6 behavior

`Filter > Distort` geometrically warps the active layer or selection. Help notes these filters "can be very memory-intensive". The submenu contains:

| Filter | Menu path | What it does (CS6 Help) |
|---|---|---|
| Diffuse Glow | `Filter > Distort > Diffuse Glow` | Renders an image as if viewed through a soft diffusion filter; adds see-through white noise, with the glow fading from the center of a selection. Filter-Gallery capable. |
| Displace | `Filter > Distort > Displace` | Uses a second image (a displacement map) to shift pixels; gray 128 = no shift, 0 = maximum negative, 255 = maximum positive. |
| Glass | `Filter > Distort > Glass` | Simulates viewing through glass; choose a built-in surface or load a Photoshop file, then adjust scaling, distortion, and smoothness. Filter-Gallery capable. |
| Ocean Ripple | `Filter > Distort > Ocean Ripple` | Adds randomly spaced ripples so the image appears underwater. Filter-Gallery capable. |
| Pinch | `Filter > Distort > Pinch` | Squeezes toward (positive) or away from (negative) the selection center. |
| Polar Coordinates | `Filter > Distort > Polar Coordinates` | Converts rectangular ⇄ polar coordinates. |
| Ripple | `Filter > Distort > Ripple` | Undulating ripple pattern; choose number and size. For more control use Wave. |
| Shear | `Filter > Distort > Shear` | Distorts along a user-drawn curve; choose how to treat undistorted areas. |
| Spherize | `Filter > Distort > Spherize` | Wraps the selection around a sphere (3D bulge/pincushion look). |
| Twirl | `Filter > Distort > Twirl` | Rotates more sharply at the center than the edges. |
| Wave | `Filter > Distort > Wave` | Like Ripple with control over generators, wavelength, amplitude, and wave type. |
| ZigZag | `Filter > Distort > ZigZag` | Radial distortion by radius; ridges and displacement style. |
| Lens Correction | `Filter > Lens Correction…` | Separate dialog; corrects barrel/pincushion distortion, chromatic aberration, vignetting, perspective and rotation. See its own spec. |

**Undefined areas.** Help groups Displace, Shear, and Wave into one rule: areas the filter leaves undefined are treated by **Wrap Around** (content from the opposite edge) or **Repeat Edge Pixels** (extend the edge color; may band). The Offset filter (Other) adds **Set To Background**. (Sourced — Help "Defining undistorted areas".)

**Glass surface controls.** Glass shares texturizing options with Rough Pastels, Underpainting, Conté Crayon, and Texturizer: choose or load a texture, set **Scaling**, **Relief** (only where available), **Invert**, and **Light Direction** (only where available). (Sourced — Help "Set texture and glass surface controls".)

**Lens Correction entry points.** The dialog has two tabs, **Auto Correction** (lens profiles, Edge handling, Auto Scale Image) and **Custom** (manual sliders). It works only on **8- and 16-bit-per-channel RGB or Grayscale**. (Sourced.)

**Bit-depth gate (Help "Filter basics").** Of the Distort family, only **Lens Correction** is listed as 16-bit capable. None of the geometric Distort filters are listed for 16-bit or 32-bit — they are 8-bit only. `Lens Correction` is 8/16-bit RGB or Grayscale only. (Sourced.)

## Algorithms & pipeline

**Behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD** where noted. The table gives the algorithm *family* each filter belongs to; Adobe's exact resampling filter, edge handling, and RNG are undocumented and must be matched by comparison renders.

| Filter | Algorithm family | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Displace | Per-pixel inverse lookup into a displacement map | Channel 1 drives horizontal, channel 2 vertical; each channel value `v` maps to shift `(v−128)/128 × scale` pixels; with one channel the shift is along the diagonal defined by the two scales. At 100% the largest shift is 128 px. Map is stretched or tiled to the selection. *[Help]* |
| Pinch / Spherize | Radial inverse-mapping warp | Normalized radial distance remapped by a monotone curve; Spherize 3D-wraps around a sphere, Pinch squeezes/expands toward center. *(inferred)* |
| Twirl | Angular inverse-mapping warp | Rotation angle falls off from center to edge; angle sign sets direction. *(inferred)* |
| Polar Coordinates | Coordinate transform | `rect→polar` and `polar→rect` with bilinear resampling. *(inferred)* |
| Ripple | Sinusoidal displacement | Periodic offsets; size sets spatial frequency. *(inferred)* |
| Wave | Multi-generator sinusoidal displacement | Sum of `N` wave generators; each has a random phase/period drawn from wavelength range, amplitude range, and type (sine/triangle/square); scale applies axis-wise; random seed makes it repeatable. *[AS]* |
| Shear | Piecewise-linear vertical shift | Curve control points interpolated; columns shift vertically by the curve; undefined rows wrap or repeat edges. *(inferred)* |
| ZigZag | Radial displacement | Amount scales magnitude, ridges set the number of direction reversals from center to edge; three styles (around center = rotation, out from center = radial, pond ripples = diagonal). *(inferred)* |
| Glass | Texture-driven refraction | A height field (built-in or loaded texture) offsets the sampling position, modulated by Distortion; Smoothness interpolates the height field; Scaling scales the texture. *(inferred; classic "glass/refraction" displacement)* |
| Ocean Ripple | Random ripple displacement | Small randomly-placed ripples; size = frequency, magnitude = amplitude. *(inferred)* |
| Diffuse Glow | Blur + noise + screen | Grainy glow: blur the selection, add white noise, screen back toward the source; glow fades toward the selection center. *(inferred)* |
| Lens Correction | Radial polynomial distortion + per-channel scaling + vignette | Undistortion is a radial polynomial (Brown–Conrady-style `r²`,`r⁴` terms) inverse-mapped; chromatic aberration scales one channel pair relative to another; vignette applies a radial gain with a midpoint; perspective/angle are homographies. Auto Correction matches EXIF to a lens profile. *(inferred model; profile coefficients are Adobe data)* |

**Pipeline.** All Distort filters are single-image, single-pass on the active layer/selection (Wave and Displace read one auxiliary input). For a Rust core they should share one `Warp` trait that renders output tiles from an input tile + a per-pixel displacement field; the filters differ only in how the field is generated. This is the lazy, GPU-friendly shape and matches how `gpu-rendering-pipeline` wants to run filters.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_filter::distort` — submodule per filter; all implement `Filter`.
- `pictura_filter::warp::Warp` — trait: `displacement(&self, ctx) -> DisplacementField`, then a shared inverse-mapping resampler.
- `pictura_filter::warp::DisplacementField` — `{ dx: Tile, dy: Tile, interpolation: Bilinear|Bicubic, edge: EdgeMode }`.
- `pictura_filter::distort::displace` — loads a `pictura_io::psd` document as the map, flattens it, picks channels 1/2.
- `pictura_filter::distort::wave` / `ripple` / `ocean_ripple` — seeded RNG (`u32 seed`) so Randomize is reproducible.
- `pictura_filter::distort::glass` — `TextureSource::{Builtin(GlassSurface), Document(PathBuf)}`; shares the texture pipeline with other texturizing filters.
- `pictura_filter::distort::lens_correction` — `CameraProfile` (distortion polynomial, CA, vignette), `Perspective { v, h, angle, scale }`; the Auto tab reads `pictura_core::metadata` (EXIF) and a profile store.
- `pictura_core::meta::Exif` — camera/lens/focal/f-stop for profile matching.
- `pictura_filter::registry` — maps filter id (and the CS6 four-char event id, e.g. `'Dspl'`, `'Twrl'`, `'Wave'`, `'ZgZg'`, `'Gls '`, `'OcnR'`) to implementation + `supported(mode, depth)`.

Crossing types: `Tile`, `Rect`, `ColorMode`, `BitDepth`, `EdgeMode`, `FilterParams` (typed enum), `DisplacementField`, `PathBuf`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `DistortOptionsDialog` | `QDialog` | Hosts each filter's small parameter form; swap-in `QStackedWidget` per filter |
| `ShearCurveEditor` | `QWidget` | Draws the shear curve grid; drag control points; Default button |
| `WaveOptionsPanel` | `QWidget` | Generators, min/max wavelength/amplitude spin boxes, type combo, Randomize |
| `DisplaceOptionsPanel` | `QWidget` | Scale spins, Stretch/Tile, Undefined combo, file chooser (deferred to post-OK open) |
| `GlassOptionsPanel` | `QWidget` | Distortion/Smoothness/Scaling sliders, texture combo + Load Texture, Invert |
| `LensCorrectionWidget` | `QWidget` (workspace) | Auto/Custom tabs, sliders, Straighten tool, grid overlay, lens-profile list |
| `FilterPreviewPane` | `QGraphicsView` | Shared preview with zoom + drag-to-center (per Help) |
| `FilterMenuBuilder` | helper | Greys Distort entries when the document mode/depth is unsupported |

Widgets over QML for the dialogs (they are dense and modal), per `ARCH-003`; the preview pane may be QML if the canvas is QML-based.

## Data-model impact

- Filters record their parameters in the history/undo record as a typed `FilterParams` enum, not raw pixels (`ARCH-009`).
- **Lens Correction Auto** stores the matched profile id + sub-profile and the auto correction flags; perspective settings are **explicitly not saved** per Help, while distortion/CA/vignette and Auto settings are saveable as settings/lens defaults. That save/load shape belongs to this spec's data model.
- Undo granularity is one command per apply. Glass/Displace reference an external PSD path; for lossless round-trip the referenced file is not embedded by Photoshop (Displace loads a separate file), so the record stores the path plus the flattened map digest for cache invalidation.
- **Smart Filters:** each Distort filter that Photoshop enables can sit on a Smart Object stack (`LAY-021`). The filter's parameter descriptor is serialized into the Smart Filter stack; the exact `FXid`/`FEid` parameter packing is unconfirmed (see `LAY-021` open questions).
- **PSD:** the layer's filtered result is plain pixels unless the layer is a Smart Object. No Distort-specific additional-layer key is documented beyond the Smart Filter record.

## Edge cases

- **8/16/32-bit.** Geometric Distort filters are 8-bit only; on 16/32-bit documents they must be greyed/disabled or converted (matching Photoshop's disabled menu). Lens Correction works on 8/16-bit RGB/Grayscale.
- **CMYK/Lab/Multichannel.** Distort filters are documented for 8-bit but some refuse CMYK/Lab; enforce per-filter `supported(mode, depth)` and grey the menu.
- **Filter Gallery boundary.** Diffuse Glow, Glass, and Ocean Ripple are applied through the Filter Gallery; the Gallery is cumulative and 8-bit only, so its ordering/preview rules apply (`06-filters/filters-overview.md`).
- **1-px or empty selection.** Radial filters (Pinch/Twirl/Spherize/ZigZag) have no meaningful center; define a no-op with no error.
- **Displace map size mismatch.** Stretch To Fit vs Tile; a map with one channel displaces diagonally; >1 channel uses channels 1 and 2. Bitmap-mode maps are rejected.
- **Huge/PSB documents.** Help warns Distort filters are memory-intensive. Render tiled, not full-canvas scratch buffers; Wave with 999 generators and large amplitude is the worst case.
- **GPU unavailable.** All warps fall back to CPU bilinear/bicubic; the cache key must include the backend.
- **Seeded randomness.** Wave's Randomize must be reproducible from a stored seed so undo/redo and re-render match.
- **Lens Correction without EXIF.** Auto Correction is unavailable; fall back to the Custom tab.
- **Lens Correction blank edges.** Edge = transparency/color/extension; Scale can crop; pixel dimensions must not change.
- **Twirl/Wave on very large canvases.** Modern Help notes Twirl "does not work on images larger than 11500px by 11500px" (current docs, not necessarily CS6); guard against overflow.
- **Undo/redo.** Store parameters + RNG seed; recompute. No pixel backup required.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given a grayscale image and Displace with a uniform 128 map, the output equals the input (no displacement) within tolerance 0.
- Given a Displace map and 100% scales, the maximum displacement is ~128 px and the shift is zero at value 128, negative below, positive above.
- Given Pinch Amount +100, pixels move toward the selection center; Amount −100 moves them outward; 0 is a no-op.
- Given Polar Coordinates Rect→Polar then Polar→Rect with the same parameters, the round-trip approximates the original within resampling tolerance.
- Given Ripple Amount 0, the output equals the input; increasing Amount increases displacement magnitude; Size changes spatial frequency.
- Given Wave with N generators and a fixed random seed, two runs produce identical output; Randomize changes the seed.
- Given Shear's curve set back to a straight line (Default), the output equals the input.
- Given Spherize Mode Horizontal Only, displacement occurs only on the horizontal axis.
- Given ZigZag Ridges = 0, the number of direction reversals from center to edge is 0 (uniform displacement direction).
- Given Twirl Angle +A and −A, the two outputs are mirror rotations in direction.
- Given Glass with Distortion 0, the output equals the input; Distortion > 0 displaces by the chosen/loaded texture.
- Given Diffuse Glow Clear Amount = maximum, the original detail is largely restored; Glow Amount = 0 removes the glow.
- Given a JPEG with an embedded EXIF camera+lens and a matching profile on disk, Lens Correction Auto corrects distortion/CA/vignette; Auto Scale Image keeps original dimensions.
- Given Lens Correction on a 16-bit RGB image, the filter runs; on a 32-bit image it is unavailable.
- Given a Distort filter and a 16-bit or CMYK document, the menu entry is disabled (except Lens Correction where supported).
- Given a PSD with a Smart Object carrying a Distort Smart Filter, opening and re-saving preserves the parameter descriptor round-trip.

## Open questions

- **Exact warp kernels.** Adobe's resampling filter (bilinear? bicubic? custom), edge clamping, and sub-pixel phase for each Distort filter are undocumented. Resolve by rendering reference pairs in a real CS6 and fitting. Until then: behavioral parity only.
- **Twirl size limit.** Current Adobe docs mention an 11500×11500 limit for Twirl; whether CS6.0 enforces it is unconfirmed. Resolve with a CS6 build test.
- **Undefined-area defaults.** The option *sets* are sourced; the dialog defaults for Wrap Around vs Repeat Edge Pixels per filter are inferred. Resolve from a CS6 screenshot or defaults file.
- **Wave generator model.** The mapping from Number of Generators + wavelength/amplitude ranges + seed to the actual displacement field is closed. Resolve by fitting rendered waves.
- **Glass/Displace texture interpretation.** Whether the texture is treated as luminance-only (Help says most filters use grayscale information) and how Smoothness interpolates it is inferred. Resolve with controlled textures.
- **Lens Correction profile format.** Adobe's `.lcp` profile coefficient model and the exact polynomial order are not public in the fetched sources. Resolve from the Lens Profile Creator docs / SDK.
- **Lens Correction slider ranges.** Help describes behavior but not numeric min/max for Remove Distortion, Fix Fringe, Vignette, Perspective, Angle, Scale. Resolve from a CS6 UI capture.
- **Smart Filter parameter packing** for each Distort filter in `FXid`/`FEid`. See `LAY-021`.
