# Artistic Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-080`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Artistic submenu and the Filter Gallery are available in CS6 Standard and Extended.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the 15 Artistic filters and their options are unchanged from CS5. CS6's new filters (Blur Gallery, Oil Paint, Camera Raw Filter, Adaptive Wide Angle) live elsewhere.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `LAY-021` smart-filters, `LAY-020` smart-objects, `LAY-010` blend-modes, `IMG-005` bit-depth-and-conversion, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-003` performance-targets.

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's kernels are closed: this document targets **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Control names are taken from Adobe Help; ranges marked *(sourced)* are from the fetched community/Adobe references listed in `## Sources`, and ranges/defaults not published by Adobe are marked *(inferred)* and must be confirmed against a CS6 build.

## CS6 behavior

**Artistic filters.** From the CS6 Help: they 

The family has **15** filters. Each redraws the image to imitate a physical medium; several use the **foreground and background colors** as their "paint" and "paper" and depend on the document's color mode (RGB/Grayscale/Multichannel — see Edge cases).

| Filter | CS6 Help behavior (sourced unless marked) |
|---|---|
| **Colored Pencil** | Draws the image with colored pencils on a solid background. Edges are retained and given a rough crosshatch appearance; the background color shows through smooth areas. |
| **Cutout** | Makes the image look like roughly cut colored paper. High-contrast images appear as silhouettes; color images are built from several paper layers. |
| **Dry Brush** | Dry-brush (between oil and watercolor) painting of the edges. Simplifies the image by reducing its color range to areas of common color. |
| **Film Grain** | Applies an even grain pattern to shadows and midtones and a smoother, more saturated pattern to lighter areas; used to hide banding and unify mixed-source elements. |
| **Fresco** | Coarse painting with short, rounded, hastily applied daubs. |
| **Neon Glow** | Adds glows to objects; colorizes the image while softening it. Glow color is chosen from a color box. |
| **Paint Daubs** | Painterly brush stamping; brush sizes 1–50 and brush **types** Simple, Light Rough, Dark Rough, Wide Sharp, Wide Blurry, Sparkle *(types and 1–50 size sourced from the CS6 PDF)*. |
| **Palette Knife** | Reduces detail to give the look of a thin painted canvas revealing texture underneath. |
| **Plastic Wrap** | Coats the image in shiny plastic, accentuating surface detail. |
| **Poster Edges** | Posterizes the image, finds edges, and draws black lines on them; broad areas get simple shading. |
| **Rough Pastels** | Applies pastel-chalk strokes on a textured background; bright areas appear thick, darker areas appear scraped to reveal texture. |
| **Smudge Stick** | Softens with short diagonal strokes that smear darker areas; lighter areas brighten and lose detail. |
| **Sponge** | Highly textured areas of contrasting color, simulating sponge painting. |
| **Underpainting** | Paints the image on a textured background, then paints the final image over it. |
| **Watercolor** | Watercolor-style painting with a medium, water-loaded brush; simplifies detail and saturates color where significant tonal changes occur at edges. |

**Filter Gallery mechanics (shared).** `Filter > Filter Gallery` opens one dialog with a preview, category thumbnails, the selected effect's options, and an applied-effect list. Effects are **cumulative and applied in list order**, can be **reordered by dragging**, **hidden with the eye icon**, and **deleted**. Clicking a category name shows its filter thumbnails; the thumbnail pane can be hidden. The gallery is **8-bit-per-channel only** (). Applied to a Smart Object, the whole stack becomes one grouped Smart Filter entry named "Filter Gallery" (`LAY-021`). Shared dialog keys, Fade, and the application pipeline are in `FILT-001`.

> Note: the source (PCWorld) states there are "15 Artistic filter options"; CS6's Artistic set matches. PS Elements Help additionally exposes several non-CS6 filters (Comic, Graphic Novel, Pen and Ink) — those are **not** CS6 Artistic filters and are excluded here.

## Algorithms & pipeline

The Artistic kernels are closed; all of the following is **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. The shared gallery/application pipeline (target resolution → depth/mode gate → apron → backend dispatch → tile iteration → selection composite → single undo commit) is in `FILT-001`.

- **Gallery stack.** Each Artistic filter is an independent stage in `pictura-filters::gallery`; the stack is evaluated in list order on the 8-bit image; drag-reorder/hide/delete mutate the stage list.
- **Color-source dependency (sourced):** several filters read the **foreground/background colors** as ink/paper — Colored Pencil, Rough Pastels, Underpainting, Watercolor, and the Neon Glow color box. The pipeline must pass the current `Foreground`/`Background` colors and the chosen glow color into the kernel.
- **Texture options (Rough Pastels, Underpainting):** a surface preset (Brick/Burlap/Canvas/Sandstone) or a loaded file is tiled under the effect, with Scaling/Relief/Light-Direction/Invert controlling a height-to-light emboss of that surface. Modeling the texture as a loadable grayscale height map, lit by the chosen direction, reproduces the documented behavior.
- **Poster Edges** is qualitatively posterization + edge detection + black edge composite: a behavioral model is `posterize(src, levels=N)` combined with a gradient/edge magnitude (Sobel-like) thresholded to draw black lines; the exact Adobe edge kernel is closed.
- **Cutout** is a posterize/quantization step with an edge-simplification and fidelity bias; the "levels/simplicity/fidelity" triad suggests a region-quantization plus contour smoothing, but this is a behavioral model.
- **Film Grain** is an additive/multiplicative noise field whose amplitude varies by tonal zone (stronger in shadows/midtones, smoother in highlights); likely a deterministic or seeded PRNG (parity requires recording the seed for reproducible redo — design choice).
- **Colored Pencil, Dry Brush, Fresco, Palette Knife, Smudge Stick, Sponge, Watercolor** are a family of "local color reduction + directional/brush reconstruction" effects. A plausible behavioral decomposition is (a) an edge/orientation map, (b) a color simplification step, and (c) a stroke/daub renderer driven by orientation and tone. Adobe does not publish the steps; treat each as a black box to be matched, not re-derived.
- **Paint Daubs** is brush stamping with a size and sharpness and one of six brush types; the types most plausibly control stamp shape/hardness and grain, but the exact brushes are closed.

**Determinism.** Randomness (film grain, daubs jitter, sponge) must be seeded so that undo/redo and PSD round-trips reproduce results; store the seed in the history/effect record.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed under `pictura-filters::artistic` (`ARCH-002`), all implementing the shared `Filter` trait (`FILT-001`):

- `pictura-filters::artistic::colored_pencil` — `ColoredPencil { width, pressure, paper_brightness }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::cutout` — `Cutout { levels, edge_simplicity, edge_fidelity }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::dry_brush` — `DryBrush { brush_size, brush_detail, texture }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::film_grain` — `FilmGrain { grain, highlight_area, intensity }`; seeded RNG.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::fresco` — `Fresco { brush_size, brush_detail, texture }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::neon_glow` — `NeonGlow { glow_size, glow_brightness, glow_color: Rgba }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::paint_daubs` — `PaintDaubs { brush_size, sharpness, brush_type: BrushType }`; `enum BrushType { Simple, LightRough, DarkRough, WideSharp, WideBlurry, Sparkle }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::palette_knife` — `PaletteKnife { stroke_size, stroke_detail, softness }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::plastic_wrap` — `PlasticWrap { highlight_strength, detail, smoothness }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::poster_edges` — `PosterEdges { edge_thickness, edge_intensity, posterization }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::rough_pastels` — `RoughPastels { stroke_length, stroke_detail, texture: TextureOptions }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::smudge_stick` — `SmudgeStick { stroke_length, highlight_area, intensity }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::sponge` — `Sponge { brush_size, definition, smoothness }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::underpainting` — `Underpainting { brush_size, texture_coverage, texture: TextureOptions }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::watercolor` — `Watercolor { brush_detail, shadow_intensity, texture }`.
- `pictura-filters::artistic::TextureOptions` — `{ texture: TextureRef, scaling: Percent, relief: u8, light_direction: LightDir, invert: bool }`; shared with Rough Pastels, Underpainting, and (in `FILT-082`) Conté Crayon.
- Shared helpers: `pictura-filters::kernel::quantize` (posterize), `pictura-filters::kernel::edge` (gradient magnitude), `pictura-filters::kernel::noise::SeededRng`, `pictura-filters::kernel::stroke`.

Crossing types: `Rect`, `TileView`, `Rgba` (foreground/background/glow), `Percent`, `LightDir`, `TextureRef`, `Seed(u64)`. No Qt types.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets, matching the CS6 modal/gallery dialogs; pixel work in Rust. Shared gallery, preview, and progress widgets are specified in `FILT-001`; this family contributes per-filter option panes.

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ArtisticOptionsPane` | `QWidget` (`QStackedWidget` page) | Hosts the selected Artistic filter's controls inside the Filter Gallery |
| `ColoredPencilPane` … `WatercolorPane` | `QWidget` | One pane per filter; sliders via `FilterSliderSpin` |
| `TextureOptionsPane` | `QWidget` | Texture preset combo + Load Texture, Scaling, Relief, Light Direction, Invert; shared by Rough Pastels / Underpainting |
| `BrushTypeCombo` | `QComboBox` | Simple / Light Rough / Dark Rough / Wide Sharp / Wide Blurry / Sparkle |
| `GlowColorButton` | `QToolButton`+`QColorDialog` | Neon Glow color box |
| `FilterGalleryDialog` | `QDialog` | Shared: category list, thumbnails, options stack, applied list, preview (`FILT-001`) |

Controls are model-driven from `FilterRegistry::params_schema()`; the pane is generated from the parameter descriptor so no per-filter hand-written widget is required beyond the shared control types.

## Data-model impact

- **Destructive apply:** no persistent document field; one `HistoryRecord::FilterOp { filter_id, roi, params_blob, seed, before_tiles, after_hash }` per committed apply (`ARCH-009`). Randomness stores the `seed`.
- **Smart Object:** each Artistic filter (or a whole Filter Gallery stack) becomes a Smart Filter entry `{ filter_id, params, blend, opacity, enabled }`; the gallery stack serializes as one grouped entry (`LAY-021`). No new document-model nodes.
- **Serialization:** the filter descriptor (filter id + typed params + seed) must be written through the Smart Filter/Filter Effects path (`LAY-021`); the mapping from each Artistic parameter to a PSD `FXid`/`FEid` key is **unsourced** (open question in `LAY-021`).
- **Color state:** foreground/background/glow colors are read from the document color state (`ARCH-008`); the filter stores them if they can change between sessions and the result must stay reproducible.
- Undo granularity is one gallery-stack apply (destructive) or one Smart Filter entry mutation (non-destructive).

## Edge cases

- **Mode:** Artistic filters act on RGB, Grayscale, and Multichannel 8-bit images (`computerhope` per-filter pages); CMYK/Lab support is per filter and must be gated by a capability mask. On unsupported mode, disable with a reason (never convert).
- **Depth:** 16-bit/32-bit are not in Adobe's 16-/32-bit filter lists, so all Artistic filters are 8-bit only; at higher depth show the Smart Filter warning icon / disable the menu item.
- **Foreground/background identity:** if fg == bg, Colored Pencil/Rough Pastels/Underpainting/Watercolor can collapse to a flat or near-flat result; do not crash or divide by zero in the paper/ink logic.
- **No selection:** apply to whole layer. **1×1 / 1-px** documents: brush- and texture-based kernels must not panic on zero-extent neighborhoods.
- **Huge PSB:** tile-local only; texture surfaces and brush stamps must be generated procedurally or tiled, not materialized full-canvas.
- **Randomness:** seeded for reproducible redo; two identical applies must match bit-for-bit.
- **Cancellation:** atomic no-op, no history state (`ARCH-003`).
- **GPU:** CPU fallback must be numerically correct; no Artistic kernel may require a GPU (`ARCH-006`).
- **Empty layer / locked pixels:** no-op or refuse per `FILT-001`.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given an 8-bit RGB document, each of the 15 Artistic filters appears under `Filter > Filter Gallery > Artistic` and opens its options; applying it produces a non-empty effect and adds exactly one history state.
2. Given a 16-bit or 32-bit document, Artistic filters are disabled (or show the Smart Filter warning) and applying is refused; no silent conversion occurs.
3. Given two Artistic filters in the gallery, changing their order changes the result; hiding one removes its contribution; deleting restores the prior state.
4. Given the same input and parameters (with the recorded seed), the result is bit-identical across CPU/GPU and across redo.
5. Given `Cutout` with `Edge Simplicity` raised and `Edge Fidelity` lowered, the filtered result renders measurably faster than the default (matches the CS6 performance note) within the `ARCH-003` budget.
6. Given `Paint Daubs`, each of the six Brush Types produces a visually distinct result; changing Brush Size 1→50 increases stroke scale monotonically.
7. Given `Poster Edges`, the output contains posterized flat areas bounded by black lines whose thickness grows with Edge Thickness.
8. Given `Neon Glow`, the glow color appears in the output and the glow's spatial extent grows with Glow Size; a negative Glow Size confines the glow to shadows.
9. Given `Colored Pencil`, changing the background color changes the paper color visible through smooth areas, and changing Paper Brightness lightens/darkens it.
10. Given a Smart Object, applying an Artistic filter adds a Smart Filters entry, leaves the underlying pixels unchanged, and reopening the entry restores the saved parameters.

## Open questions

- **Dry Brush / Fresco range conflict.** PCWorld reports Brush Size/Brush Detail **0–10**, while the CS6 dialog is widely reported as **1–50 / 1–12**. Which is CS6-at-launch? Resolve by reading the CS6 dialog directly.
- **Poster Edges posterization maximum.** PCWorld says **0–6**; older sources say **0–10**. Confirm the CS6 maximum.
- **All defaults.** Adobe does not publish Filter Gallery defaults; every "Default" above is *(inferred)*. Resolve by a scripted read of each CS6 dialog (or reference screenshots).
- **Unlisted ranges.** Smudge Stick, Sponge, Underpainting, Watercolor, Rough Pastels ranges are *(inferred)*. Same resolution.
- **Foreground/background semantics per filter.** Which of the 15 read fg/bg and in which role (ink vs paper) is only partly documented. Resolve empirically with distinct fg/bg swatches.
- **Texture surface format.** Whether the Rough Pastels/Underpainting presets are fixed grayscale height maps and how Scaling/Relief/Light Direction combine is undocumented. Resolve by matching a reference render with a known loaded texture.
- **Randomness control.** Whether the Gallery exposes any seed/re-randomize control for Film Grain/sponge-daubs (Photoshop does not visibly expose one) is unconfirmed; our design choice is a hidden seeded RNG.
- **`FXid`/`FEid` parameter mapping.** See `LAY-021`; the per-filter parameter descriptor keys are unsourced, so lossless PSD round-trip of a Smart-Object-gallery is unproven.
