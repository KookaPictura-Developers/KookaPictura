# Brush Stroke Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-081`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Brush Stroke submenu and the Filter Gallery are in CS6 Standard and Extended.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the 8 Brush Stroke filters are unchanged from CS5.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `LAY-021` smart-filters, `LAY-020` smart-objects, `LAY-010` blend-modes, `IMG-005` bit-depth-and-conversion, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-003` performance-targets.

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's kernels are closed: **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Control names are taken from the CS6 Help PDF and Adobe Help; ranges marked *(sourced)* are from the fetched references in `## Sources`; unmarked defaults/ranges are *(inferred)* and must be confirmed against a CS6 build.

## CS6 behavior

**Brush Stroke filters.** From the CS6 Help: 

The family has **8** filters. All are **8-bit only** and run in the Filter Gallery. Two of them (`Spatter`, `Sumi-e`) are called out by the Help as memory-intensive: .

| Filter | CS6 Help behavior (sourced) |
|---|---|
| **Accented Edges** | Accentuates image edges. High **Edge Brightness** makes accents resemble white chalk; low makes them resemble black ink. |
| **Angled Strokes** | Repaints using diagonal strokes; lighter and darker areas are painted with strokes going in opposite directions. |
| **Crosshatch** | Preserves detail while adding texture and roughening colored-area edges with simulated pencil hatching. **Strength** (1–3) is the number of hatching passes. |
| **Dark Strokes** | Paints dark areas with short, tight, dark strokes and light areas with long, white strokes. |
| **Ink Outlines** | Redraws the image with fine narrow lines over the original details, in pen-and-ink style. |
| **Spatter** | Replicates a spatter airbrush; increasing the options simplifies the overall effect. Memory-intensive. |
| **Sprayed Strokes** | Repaints using the image's dominant colors with angled, sprayed strokes. Memory-intensive. |
| **Sumi-e** | Paints in Japanese style, as if with a fully saturated brush on rice paper; soft blurred edges with rich inky blacks. |

**Filter Gallery mechanics (shared).** `Filter > Filter Gallery` presents one dialog with a preview, category thumbnails, the selected effect's options, and an applied-effect list. Effects are **cumulative and applied in list order**, can be **reordered by dragging**, **hidden with the eye icon**, and **deleted**. The gallery is **8-bit-per-channel only**. Applied to a Smart Object, the whole stack becomes one grouped "Filter Gallery" Smart Filter entry (`LAY-021`). Shared keys, Fade, and the pipeline are in `FILT-001`.

**Fade note (sourced):** the Help's `Edit > Fade` description explicitly says Fade

## Algorithms & pipeline

All Brush Stroke kernels are closed; **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. Shared application pipeline in `FILT-001`.

- **Gallery stack.** Each filter is an independent stage in `pictura-filters::gallery`, evaluated in list order on the 8-bit image.
- **Stroke-and-edge family (behavioral model).** Accented Edges, Angled Strokes, Crosshatch, Dark Strokes, Ink Outlines, Spatter, Sprayed Strokes, and Sumi-e are variations on **edge/orientation detection + directional stroke rendering + tonal gating**:
  - an edge/gradient stage supplies stroke direction and strength;
  - a stroke rasterizer stamps directional marks whose length/width come from the controls;
  - a tonal gate decides whether a pixel receives dark (shadow) or light (highlight) strokes (explicit in Dark Strokes, Angled Strokes, Sumi-e);
  - Spatter/Sprayed Strokes add a **scatter/jitter** term (airbrush-like), which is why they are memory-intensive and why increasing the options "simplifies" the result.
- **Crosshatch** applies a 1–3 pass hatching overlay on top of a detail-preserving base, matching the "number of hatching passes" description.
- **Randomness/determinism.** Spatter and Sprayed Strokes scatter probabilistically; use a **seeded RNG** stored in the history/effect record so redo and PSD round-trips are reproducible.
- **Memory.** Spatter and Sprayed Strokes are named in the Help's performance list; the implementation must be tile-local with a bounded apron and must stream rather than allocate per-stroke large buffers (`ARCH-003`).
- **Accented Edges brightness mapping.** Edge Brightness 25 = edges not outlined (source: AliveColors, corroborated by the Help's chalk/ink description); below 25 darkens, above 25 lightens. Treat the exact crossover as behavioral.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed under `pictura-filters::brush_stroke` (`ARCH-002`), implementing the shared `Filter` trait (`FILT-001`):

- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::accented_edges` — `AccentedEdges { edge_width, edge_brightness, smoothness }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::angled_strokes` — `AngledStrokes { direction_balance, stroke_length, sharpness }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::crosshatch` — `Crosshatch { stroke_length, sharpness, strength }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::dark_strokes` — `DarkStrokes { balance, black_intensity, white_intensity }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::ink_outlines` — `InkOutlines { stroke_length, dark_intensity, light_intensity }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::spatter` — `Spatter { spray_radius, smoothness }`; seeded RNG.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::sprayed_strokes` — `SprayedStrokes { stroke_length, spray_radius, direction: StrokeDirection }`; `enum StrokeDirection { RightDiagonal, Horizontal, LeftDiagonal, Vertical }`.
- `pictura-filters::brush_stroke::sumi_e` — `SumiE { stroke_width, stroke_pressure, contrast }`.
- Shared helpers: `pictura-filters::kernel::edge` (gradient/orientation), `pictura-filters::kernel::stroke`, `pictura-filters::kernel::noise::SeededRng`.

Crossing types: `Rect`, `TileView`, `StrokeDirection`, `Seed(u64)`. No Qt types.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets, matching the CS6 Filter Gallery; pixel work in Rust. Shared gallery/preview/progress widgets are in `FILT-001`.

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `BrushStrokeOptionsPane` | `QWidget` (`QStackedWidget` page) | Hosts the selected Brush Stroke filter's controls |
| `AccentedEdgesPane` … `SumiEPane` | `QWidget` | One pane per filter; sliders via `FilterSliderSpin` |
| `StrokeDirectionCombo` | `QComboBox` | Right Diagonal / Horizontal / Left Diagonal / Vertical (Sprayed Strokes, and Graphic Pen in `FILT-082`) |
| `FilterGalleryDialog` | `QDialog` | Shared category list, thumbnails, options stack, applied list, preview (`FILT-001`) |

Panes are generated from the filter's parameter descriptor; `StrokeDirectionCombo` is the only family-specific control type.

## Data-model impact

- **Destructive apply:** no persistent field; one `HistoryRecord::FilterOp { filter_id, roi, params_blob, seed, before_tiles, after_hash }` per committed apply (`ARCH-009`); scatter filters store the `seed`.
- **Smart Object:** each Brush Stroke filter (or a gallery stack) becomes a Smart Filter entry `{ filter_id, params, blend, opacity, enabled }`; the gallery stack is one grouped entry (`LAY-021`). No new document-model nodes.
- **Serialization:** descriptors are written through the Smart Filter/Filter Effects path (`LAY-021`); the per-parameter `FXid`/`FEid` key mapping is **unsourced**.
- Undo granularity is one apply.

## Edge cases

- **Mode:** Brush Stroke filters target 8-bit RGB/Grayscale/Multichannel images; CMYK/Lab support is per filter and must be capability-gated (never convert).
- **Depth:** 16-bit/32-bit are not in Adobe's filter depth lists → 8-bit only; disable/show warning at higher depth.
- **Selection edge:** edge-detection stages read an apron outside the selection; decide and pin the sampling behavior (see `FILT-001`).
- **1×1 / 1-px documents:** stroke rasterization must handle zero-extent neighborhoods without panics.
- **Huge PSB:** tile-local; scattered strokes must not allocate full-canvas buffers; Spatter/Sprayed Strokes bound their sampling.
- **Randomness:** seeded for reproducible redo; two identical applies match bit-for-bit.
- **Cancellation:** atomic no-op (`ARCH-003`).
- **GPU:** CPU fallback must be correct; no kernel requires a GPU (`ARCH-006`).
- **Empty/locked layer:** no-op or refuse per `FILT-001`.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given an 8-bit RGB document, each of the 8 Brush Stroke filters appears under `Filter > Filter Gallery > Brush Stroke` and in `Filter > Brush Stroke`, opens its options, produces a non-empty effect, and adds exactly one history state.
2. Given a 16-bit/32-bit document, Brush Stroke filters are disabled or show the Smart Filter warning; applying is refused with no conversion.
3. Given two Brush Stroke filters in the gallery, reordering changes the result; hiding one removes its contribution.
4. Given `Crosshatch` Strength 1 vs 3, the number of visible hatching passes increases; Growth is monotonic.
5. Given `Accented Edges` at Edge Brightness 25, edges are not outlined (neutral); below 25 accents darken; above 25 accents lighten.
6. Given `Dark Strokes`, raising Balance increases the proportion of dark strokes while Black/White Intensity independently darken/lighten their respective regions.
7. Given `Spatter`/`Sprayed Strokes`, increasing Spray Radius scatters strokes over a wider area; results are reproducible from the stored seed.
8. Given `Ink Outlines`, fine narrow line detail is retained over the original; increasing Dark/Light Intensity strengthens the dark/light line components.
9. Given identical input, parameters, and seed, CPU and GPU paths agree within 1 LSB (8-bit) and redo is bit-exact.
10. Given a Smart Object, applying a Brush Stroke filter adds a Smart Filters entry, leaves the pixels unchanged, and reopening restores saved parameters.

## Open questions

- **Which Brush Strokes support CMYK/Lab.** The 8-bit RGB/Grayscale/Multichannel support is documented for some filters in community pages; per-filter CMYK/Lab capability must be read back from CS6.
- **All defaults.** Adobe does not publish Filter Gallery defaults; every "Default" above is *(inferred)*. Resolve by a scripted CS6 dialog read.
- **Unlisted ranges.** Only Crosshatch Strength (1–3) and the Accented Edges/Dark Strokes ranges are sourced; Angled Strokes, Ink Outlines, Spatter, Sprayed Strokes, Sumi-e ranges are *(inferred)*.
- **Stroke Direction enumeration/default.** Whether CS6's Sprayed Strokes offers exactly the four directions and the default direction is *(inferred)* from the CS6 dialog family; confirm.
- **Scatter determinism.** Whether Photoshop's Spatter/Sprayed Strokes randomness is seeded/reproducible or fresh per apply is unknown; our design choice is a stored seed, which may not match Adobe's exact output (behavioral parity only).
- **`FXid`/`FEid` parameter mapping.** See `LAY-021`; the per-filter parameter descriptor keys are unsourced.
- **Spatter vs. Sprayed Strokes overlap.** Both scatter ink; the exact differentiating model (radius vs. length/direction) is behavioral only.
