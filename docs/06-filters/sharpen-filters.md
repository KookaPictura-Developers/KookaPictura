# Sharpen Filters

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-020`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — Sharpen, Sharpen Edges, Sharpen More, Unsharp Mask, and Smart Sharpen are CS6 Standard.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the Sharpen submenu is unchanged from CS5. **Shake Reduction is *not* a CS6 feature**: it was introduced in **Photoshop CC (2013)** and is documented here as an explicit **non-parity / CC-only** entry because the brief requested it. See `## CS6 behavior`.
- **Depends on:** `FILT-001` filters-overview, `FILT-010` blur-filters (Smart Sharpen's `Remove = Gaussian Blur` and USM share the Gaussian kernel), `LAY-010` blend-modes (Luminosity fade), `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `IMG-009` 32-bit-hdr, `LAY-004` layer-masks.

> All module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adobe's exact sharpening kernels are closed; parity is **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**. The CS6 Help describes the controls and qualitative results; algorithm families are drawn from the standard references cited under `## Sources`. Any **Shake Reduction** content is **CC-only** and cannot be CS6-parity.

## CS6 behavior

The Sharpen filters "focus blurred images by increasing the contrast of adjacent pixels." The Help's guidance: reduce noise before sharpening; sharpen in small passes; judge on the output medium; use Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen for control, because the other three are **automatic with no options**.

- **Sharpen / Sharpen More** — focus a selection by increasing edge contrast; **Sharpen More** is the stronger of the two. Both are immediate commands with **no dialog**.
- **Sharpen Edges** — finds where significant color changes occur and sharpens **only the edges**, preserving overall smoothness; no options.
- **Unsharp Mask (USM)** — locates pixels that differ in value from their surroundings by more than a **Threshold**, then increases their contrast by an **Amount**, over a **Radius**. It is *not* an edge detector: the Help stresses  Oversharpening creates **halos**. On-screen effect is more pronounced than in high-resolution print. Advice: radius 1–2 for high-res; amount 150–200% for high-res print; threshold 2–20 to avoid noise/posterization; default threshold 0 sharpens every pixel.
- **Smart Sharpen** — the recommended general sharpener; adds controls USM lacks. It has **Basic** and **Advanced** modes:
  - **Basic:** Amount, Radius, Remove (Gaussian Blur / Lens Blur / Motion Blur), Angle (for Motion Blur), More Accurate.
  - **Advanced:** the Basic controls plus **Shadow** and **Highlight** tabs to damp halos in dark/light areas: **Fade Amount**, **Tonal Width**, **Radius**. The Help states these tabs are **available only for 8- and 16-bit-per-channel images** (not 32-bit).
  - **Remove** choices: **Gaussian Blur** = the USM method; **Lens Blur** = detects edges/detail and gives finer detail with reduced halos; **Motion Blur** = attempts to reduce camera/subject-motion blur, using **Angle**.
  - **More Accurate** processes more slowly for a more accurate removal of blurring.
- **Shake Reduction (CC-only)** — automatically reduces blur caused by camera shake. It was introduced in Photoshop CC (2013), after CS6, and does not exist in a CS6 install. Kooka Pictura targets CS6 parity, so Shake Reduction is **out of parity scope**; if implemented at all it would be a CC-behavior extension (blind deconvolution). It is **not asserted as CS6 behavior**.

**Applying to one layer at a time:** USM and Smart Sharpen apply to a single layer even when layers are linked or grouped; merging/flattening is required to sharpen all image layers. Both can be applied to a **selection** or restricted by an **edge mask**. To avoid color shifts on a separate sharpening layer, the Help recommends setting the layer's blending mode to **Luminosity**, and using `Edit > Fade Unsharp Mask` with mode **Luminosity** when bright colors become oversaturated.

## Algorithms & pipeline

Adobe kernels are closed; the following are the standard families that reproduce the documented behavior. **Behavioral parity only.**

### Sharpen / Sharpen More — fixed high-pass convolution
- A 3×3 sharpening kernel of the form `[0 −1 0; −1 5 −1; 0 −1 0]` (the canonical USM-derived "sharpen" kernel): the center pixel is boosted by 4× the local Laplacian. **Sharpen More** uses a stronger fixed gain. Apply to luminance to reduce color fringing (an option; Photoshop applies per channel).
- Reference: Wikipedia *Unsharp masking* §Implementation gives this exact kernel and its derivation.

### Sharpen Edges — edge-gated sharpening
- Run edge detection (gradient magnitude) and apply the high-pass gain only where the gradient exceeds a fixed threshold, leaving flat areas alone. No controls → fixed internal threshold.

### Unsharp Mask — blur-difference sharpening
- Compute a **blurred** copy (Gaussian, `FILT-010`), then `sharpened = original + (original − blurred) × amount`, with a **threshold** gate: only where `|original − blurred|` (or the local difference) exceeds the threshold. This is the canonical digital unsharp-mask formula. Amount controls the overshoot magnitude; radius controls the width of the edge rims/halos; threshold prevents sharpening smooth, low-contrast areas (which would amplify noise).
- Implement via the separable Gaussian kernel; the "difference" can be applied in a single combined convolution (Dirac − Gaussian) for speed.
- Reference: Wikipedia *Unsharp masking* (formula, amount/radius/threshold semantics, halo cause).

### Smart Sharpen — deconvolution-flavored sharpening
- The three **Remove** modes are sharpening algorithms that differ in the assumed blur model:
  - **Gaussian Blur** = the USM (Gaussian high-pass) method — the baseline.
  - **Lens Blur** = an edge/detail-aware deconvolution-like method giving finer detail and **reduced halos**; family: deconvolution with a lens/defocus PSF or a detail-preserving edge model.
  - **Motion Blur** = directional deconvolution using a **linear motion PSF** at **Angle**; family: 1-D deconvolution along the motion direction.
  - **More Accurate** trades time for a better blur estimate (iterative/multi-scale).
- **Advanced Shadow/Highlight fade** is a **tonal-range gate**, closely related to layer "Blend If": for each pixel, Fade Amount scales the sharpening contribution when the pixel lies in the shadow (or highlight) tonal band; Tonal Width sets the band width; Radius sets the neighborhood used to decide the pixel's tonality. This is how the Help describes reducing halos in dark/light areas. 8-/16-bit only in CS6.
- Reference: Wikipedia *Unsharp masking* §Comparison with deconvolution (USM is a linear convolution; deconvolution is a nonlinear inverse problem using a PSF model).

### Shake Reduction (CC-only) — blind deconvolution
- Estimate a **point-spread function** from the camera-shake trajectory and deconvolve the image. This is a blind/parametric deconvolution problem and is **not in CS6**. If built, it is a CC-behavior extension, not parity; document separately.
- Reference: search results identify the feature as introduced in CC (2013), e.g. ExtremeTech's "Photoshop CC: Hands on with camera Shake Reduction".

### Shared pipeline
Apply through `FILT-001`: depth/mode gate → **apron** of `radius` → backend dispatch (GPU compute where ported, else `rayon` CPU) → tile iteration with progress/cancel → selection/mask composite → Luminosity handling → single undo commit. For **Smart Sharpen Shadow/Highlight** and any tonal gate, evaluate in a luminance-preserving space and keep 32-bit float unclamped.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed under `pictura-filters::sharpen` (`ARCH-002`, `ARCH-006`):

- `pictura-filters::sharpen::fixed` — `Sharpen`, `SharpenMore`, `SharpenEdges`; fixed 3×3 high-pass kernels with per-variant gain and (for Edges) a fixed gradient gate.
- `pictura-filters::sharpen::usm` — `UnsharpMask { amount: f32, radius: f32, threshold: u8 }`; blurred-difference with threshold; reuses `blur::gaussian`.
- `pictura-filters::sharpen::smart` — `SmartSharpen { amount, radius, remove: Remove, angle, more_accurate, shadow: TonalFade, highlight: TonalFade }`; `Remove = Gaussian|Lens|Motion`, each a strategy implementation of a `SharpenModel` trait; `TonalFade { fade_amount, tonal_width, radius }`.
- `pictura-filters::sharpen::shake_reduction` — **CC-only, not parity**; `ShakeReduction { ... }` behind a feature flag, blind-deconvolution research placeholder. Not part of the CS6 registry default.
- Shared helpers: `pictura-filters::luma` (luminance-preserving application), `threshold_gate`.

Types: `Amount(f32)` (%), `Radius(f32)`, `Threshold(u8)`, `Remove`, `TonalFade`. Crosses `TileView` ROIs; no Qt types.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets, matching the CS6 modal dialogs.

- `UnsharpMaskDialog` — `QDoubleSpinBox` amount, radius; `QSpinBox` threshold; preview pane.
- `SmartSharpenDialog` — `QTabWidget` (Sharpen, Shadow, Highlight); Basic/Advanced toggle; `Remove` `QComboBox`, `Angle` dial, `More Accurate` checkbox; Shadow/Highlight controls disabled on 32-bit documents with a reason.
- `SharpenPreview` (`QLabel`/`QImage`) — shared preview with +/- zoom and click-hold compare.
- `FilterProgressProxy` — shared cancelable progress.
- `ShakeReductionDialog` — present only in a CC-extension build; must not appear in CS6-parity mode.

## Data-model impact

- **No persistent fields** for destructive sharpen filters. One `HistoryRecord::FilterOp` per apply (`ARCH-009`).
- **USM / Smart Sharpen** store `{ amount, radius, threshold, remove, angle, more_accurate, shadow, highlight }` in the record's `params_blob`; all are re-editable from the Smart Filter entry if applied to a Smart Object (`LAY-021`).
- **Luminosity recommendations** are UI guidance, not stored state; `Edit > Fade` mode is a one-shot composite (`FILT-001`).
- **Shake Reduction** (CC extension) would need an estimated PSF/seed stored for redo; excluded from the parity model.

## Edge cases

- **Threshold above the local contrast.** USM with a high threshold leaves low-contrast areas untouched (by design); ensure the gate is on the same scale (0–255 for 8/16-bit; define for 32-bit float).
- **Amount 0 / Radius 0.** Identity; commit consistently or refuse.
- **Clipping/halos.** Oversharpening clips highlights/shadows; the design must not wrap or overflow; clamp only at the final 8/16-bit store, never in the 32-bit pipeline.
- **Color fringing.** Per-channel sharpening can shift hue; Luminosity mode/fade must be available and correct.
- **8/16 vs 32-bit.** Smart Sharpen Shadow/Highlight tabs must be **disabled** on 32-bit (sourced restriction).
- **CMYK / Lab / Grayscale / Multichannel.** Run per channel in the document space; Luminosity fade respects `FILT-001` Lab restrictions.
- **1-px / tiny images.** Edge kernels need border handling; clamp-to-edge, no panics.
- **Huge PSB.** Tile-local; deconvolution-style methods must bound their working set per tile with an apron.
- **GPU unavailable / device lost.** CPU path; identical results within tolerance.
- **Cancellation / undo.** Atomic; no partial writes; one history state.
- **Randomness.** None of these filters is random; redo is deterministic.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a blurred edge, `Sharpen`, `Sharpen Edges`, and `Sharpen More` all increase edge contrast, with `Sharpen More` visibly stronger than `Sharpen`, and `Sharpen Edges` leaving flat regions unchanged.
2. Given a uniform image, USM with any Amount/Radius leaves it unchanged within 1 LSB (no-op on zero-contrast areas).
3. Given a step edge, USM amount A and radius R produce an overshoot proportional to A and an edge-rim width proportional to R, within a stated tolerance of a reference blurred-difference implementation.
4. Given adjacent pixels differing by less than Threshold, USM does not change them; differing by Threshold or more, it does. Threshold 0 sharpens every pixel (sourced behavior).
5. Given Smart Sharpen `Remove = Gaussian Blur`, output matches USM at the same Amount/Radius/Threshold within tolerance; `Remove = Lens Blur` produces less halo at the same Amount/Radius; `Remove = Motion Blur` with Angle θ emphasizes edges perpendicular to the motion direction.
6. Given Advanced mode with a Shadow Fade Amount > 0, dark-region halos are reduced relative to the same settings without fade; Tonal Width changes which tones are damped; these controls are disabled on 32-bit documents.
7. Given a selection, only the selection is sharpened; given an edge mask, only masked areas are sharpened.
8. Given sharpening on a separate Luminosity layer (or `Fade ... Luminosity`), hue shifts along edges are reduced versus Normal mode.
9. Given a 32-bit HDR document, USM/Smart Sharpen outputs are not clamped at 1.0.
10. Given any apply, undo is bit-exact and adds exactly one history state; cancelling adds none.
11. Given CS6-parity mode, `Filter > Sharpen > Shake Reduction` is **absent**; if a CC-extension build adds it, it is clearly labelled non-parity.

## Open questions

- **Shake Reduction provenance.** Multiple secondary sources place it in Photoshop CC (2013), and it is absent from the fetched CS6 Help PDF. Confirm there was no separate CS6 update channel that shipped it; if confirmed absent, keep it out of parity (current stance).
- **Exact CS6 ranges/defaults.** The fetched PDF states no numeric ranges for USM Amount/Radius, Smart Sharpen Amount/Radius, or the Shadow/Highlight controls. Ranges above are *(inferred)* from modern Photoshop and community sources. Resolve by scripted CS6 dialog reads.
- **Gaussian `Remove` == USM exactly?** Whether Smart Sharpen with `Remove = Gaussian Blur` is bit-identical to USM at the same settings, or merely equivalent in family, is unverified. Resolve by comparison.
- **Lens Blur / Motion Blur `Remove` algorithms.** Adobe does not document the PSF or deconvolution method. Behavioral parity is the requirement; a design spike must pick a concrete algorithm (e.g. Wiener/Richardson–Lucy) and match halos/detail qualitatively.
- **Shadow/Highlight tonal gate formula.** The relationship between Fade Amount, Tonal Width, and Radius and the actual per-pixel gate is closed. Resolve with tonal-step probes.
- **32-bit behavior of Smart Sharpen.** 32-bit is supported (list), but Shadow/Highlight tabs are disabled; confirm the exact 32-bit default and whether `More Accurate` is available.
- **Threshold scale in 32-bit.** How the 0–255 threshold maps to float HDR values is undocumented. Resolve by experiment.
- **Defaults.** Default Amount/Radius/Remove and the USM default Amount are unverified.
