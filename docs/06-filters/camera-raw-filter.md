# Camera Raw Filter (ACR 7)

- **Spec ID:** `FILT-100`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` for the **ACR 7 raw engine** (opening camera raw files, per-image metadata edits, open-as-Smart-Object). `Non-goal (post-CS6)` for the `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` menu command — that command is **not** in CS6.
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 shipped **Camera Raw 7.0** with **Process Version 2012** (PV2012): rewritten Basic tone controls (`Highlights`, `Shadows`, `Whites`, `Blacks`), new local corrections (white balance, highlights, shadows, noise, moiré), camera profiles, and the `Snapshots` tab. **Correction:** the title premise is inaccurate — `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` was introduced in **Photoshop CC (v14, 2013)**, not CS6. CS6 exposes ACR only as the raw-file processing engine / open-as-Smart-Object path. See `## Open questions`.
- **Depends on:** `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `01-architecture/color-management.md`, `01-architecture/file-formats.md`, `LAY-020` smart-objects, `LAY-021` smart-filters, `10-workflow-io/camera-raw-workflow.md`, `04-image-ops/32-bit-hdr.md`, `04-image-ops/image-modes.md`, `06-filters/lens-correction.md`

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF unless marked *(inferred)*. Adobe's ACR implementation is closed; internal algorithm claims are marked **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD**.

## CS6 behavior

Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) is a separate plug-in bundled with Photoshop, Bridge, and After Effects. In CS6 the shipped version is **ACR 7.0** (CS6 is compatible with later ACR updates up to **9.1.1**, per Adobe community reports). It interprets a camera raw file (the raw, unprocessed grayscale sensor data read from a digital camera, together with capture metadata) and builds a color image. ACR can also edit **JPEG and TIFF** files (already-processed pixels).

**How the user reaches it in CS6 (no Filter-menu entry):**
- From Bridge: select raw/JPEG/TIFF files, `File > Open In Camera Raw` (`Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R`).
- From Photoshop: `File > Open` a raw file (ACR opens), or open a raw file as a **Smart Object** (`Shift` while clicking `Open Image`) so ACR settings stay editable by double-clicking the layer.
- ACR cannot save a camera raw file; raw data is preserved, and adjustments are stored as metadata (Camera Raw database, sidecar `.XMP`, or inside a DNG).

> **Correction, sourced:** Adobe community experts and Adobe's own CC tutorials state that the ACR filter was not part of CS6 but was introduced in Photoshop CC, and that ACR is not a filter in CS6. The CS6 Help PDF likewise contains no `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` item. Any menu-based ACR filter in this project is therefore an intentional **post-CS6 extension**, not parity.

**Dialog overview (CS6):** Filmstrip (multi-image), camera name / file format label, full-screen toggle, **image adjustment tabs**, histogram (with shadow/highlight clipping toggles), Camera Raw Settings menu, zoom controls/tool, Workflow Options link, navigation arrows, adjustment sliders, and the `Save Image` / `Open Image` / `Done` / `Cancel` actions.

**Image adjustment tabs** (CS6, ACR 7):
- **Basic** — white balance, color saturation, tonality.
- **Tone Curve** — nested `Parametric` (Highlights/Lights/Darks/Shadows region sliders, draggable region dividers; Targeted Adjustment tool) and `Point` (drag points; `Curve` menu preset, default **Medium Contrast**).
- **Detail** — sharpening (`Amount`, `Radius`, `Detail`, `Masking`) and Noise Reduction (luminance: `Luminance`, `Luminance Detail`, `Luminance Contrast`; chroma: `Color`, `Color Detail`).
- **HSL / Grayscale** — nested `Hue` / `Saturation` / `Luminance` tabs over the eight color ranges; `Convert To Grayscale` reveals a single `Grayscale Mix` tab.
- **Split Toning** — `Highlights Hue/Saturation`, `Shadows Hue/Saturation`, `Balance`. (Tones grayscale images; also used for cross-process effects.)
- **Lens Corrections** — nested `Profile` (auto profile correction) and `Manual` (transform, chromatic aberration, vignette) tabs, plus a `Color` tab for chromatic-aberration/fringe work in 7.1+.
- **Effects** — `Grain` (`Amount`, `Size`, `Roughness`) and **Post Crop Vignetting** (`Style` = Highlight Priority / Color Priority / Paint Overlay; `Amount`, `Midpoint`, `Roundness`, `Feather`, `Highlights`).
- **Camera Calibration** — `Camera Profile` (Adobe Standard / Camera Matching / Embedded), calibration sliders, and `Process` version selector.
- **Presets** — save/apply named subsets of settings.
- **Snapshots** — create named renditions of the full edit state; rename, update-with-current, delete; interoperates with Lightroom.

**Process Versions:** **PV2012** (new in ACR 7) offers the new Basic tone controls and tone-mapping for high-contrast images; **PV2010** (ACR 6) and **PV2003** (ACR 5.x and earlier) remain selectable. Older images can be updated via the exclamation-point "Update to Current Process" button or `Camera Calibration > Process > 2012`.

**Local adjustments:** `Adjustment Brush` (`K`) and `Graduated Filter` (`G`). Adjustable effects (PV2012) include `Temp`, `Tint`, `Exposure`, `Highlights`, `Shadows`, `Contrast`, `Saturation`, `Clarity`, `Sharpness`, `Noise Reduction`, `Moiré Reduction`, `Defringe`, `Color`. Brush options: `Size`, `Feather`, `Flow`, `Density`, `Auto Mask`, `Show Mask`. Graduated filter uses a red/green overlay with rotation and range handles. Local presets are managed from the Camera Raw Settings menu and cannot be saved into image presets.

**Other tools:** Rotate 90° CCW (`L`) / CW (`R`); `Straighten` (`A`, then Crop activates); `Crop` (`C`, aspect-ratio menu, move/scale/rotate handles); `Red Eye Removal` (`E`, `Pupil Size`, `Darken`); `Spot Removal` (`Type` = Heal / Clone, `Radius`, draggable source/target circles). Up to nine color samplers; shadow/highlight clipping previews (`U` / `O`); HDR editing for 16-/24-/32-bit float TIFF/DNG in ACR 7.1+ (Basic `Exposure` range expands to +10…−10).

**Workflow Options:** `Space` (target profile), `Depth` (8- or 16-bpc), `Size`, `Resolution`, `Sharpen For` + `Amount`, `Open In Photoshop As Smart Objects`. Save formats from ACR: DNG (compatibility, lossless / linear demosaiced, embedded JPEG preview, embed original raw), JPEG, TIFF, PSD.

**Limits:** ACR supports images up to 65,000 px long/wide and up to 512 MP; CMYK images are converted to RGB on open.

## Algorithms & pipeline

*(inferred / behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD.)* Adobe's raw pipeline is closed. The following staging is the observable order and the standard model for a raw converter; it is a design target, not a publicly documented spec.

1. **Decode / demosaic** — parse the camera container, unpack the Bayer/CFA (or X-Trans etc.) sensor data, apply black-level and gain, and reconstruct full RGB by demosaicing. Standard algorithms (bilinear, AHD, AMaZE, etc.) are candidates; **demosaic parity is TBD** and may be delegated to an existing decoder library.
2. **White balance** — apply scene illuminant as multipliers; `Temperature` and `Tint` map to a chromatic adaptation (e.g. Bradford) against the camera-native white point. `White Balance` tool solves for the multipliers that neutralize a clicked pixel. *(inferred)*
3. **Camera profile / color matrix** — transform camera-native RGB into a working color space using an Adobe Standard / Camera Matching profile (not an ICC profile per the PDF). Profiles map to the reference colorimetry; matrix/interpolation model is closed.
4. **Tone mapping (PV2012)** — global tone controls operate on a scene-referred/working-linear signal: `Exposure` (gain, f-stop units), `Highlights`/`Shadows` (range-selective), `Whites`/`Blacks` (endpoint/clipping), `Contrast` (mid-tone S-curve). The exact tone curves and region definitions are **behavioral parity only**.
5. **Local adjustments** — Adjustment Brush and Graduated Filter produce per-pixel masks; each mask applies a specified effect delta. Mask math (feather/flow/density/auto-mask) is locally defined. *(inferred)*
6. **Detail** — sharpening is "a variation of Unsharp Mask" (PDF): computes a detail signal, applies `Amount`, with `Radius`, `Detail` (high-frequency weighting) and `Masking` (edge mask). Noise reduction splits luminance vs chroma; the PDF describes thresholds but not the filter core.
7. **Lens corrections** — profile-based or manual (see `FILT-101`); applied in the raw domain.
8. **Effects** — film-grain synthesis (`Amount`, `Size`, `Roughness`) and post-crop vignette with three blend styles.
9. **Output transform** — crop/straighten/rotate, resize, optional output sharpening, and conversion to the chosen `Space`/`Depth`, then either opened in Photoshop (optionally as a Smart Object wrapping the raw source) or saved to DNG/JPEG/TIFF/PSD.

Settings are metadata only; the raw data is never overwritten. For a Photoshop integration, the same settings record drives both the interactive preview and the final render, so the renderer must be deterministic and cacheable.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_raw::AcrParams` — the full serialized settings tree (per-tab structs); the single source of truth for rendering. `Copy + Serialize`.
- `pictura_raw::decode::RawFile` — container parse + sensor data + metadata (EXIF, WB, camera/lens IDs). Candidate backing: a permissively licensed raw decoder crate or an in-house decoder; **decision deferred**.
- `pictura_raw::pipeline::Acr7` — `render(RawFile, &AcrParams, ProcessVersion) -> LinearImage`; stage graph for WB → profile → tone → local → detail → lens → effects → output.
- `pictura_raw::wb` — white-balance multipliers and illuminant solving (`Temp`/`Tint` ↔ chromatic adaptation).
- `pictura_raw::profile::CameraProfile` — Adobe Standard / Camera Matching lookup; `Embedded` fallback.
- `pictura_raw::tone::Pv2012` — region-selective tone controls and target curve; `Pv2010`, `Pv2003` variants.
- `pictura_raw::local::{BrushMask, GraduatedMask}` — sparse mask representation and effect application.
- `pictura_raw::detail::{Sharpen, NoiseReduction}`.
- `pictura_raw::lens` — reused by `FILT-101`.
- `pictura_raw::effects::{Grain, PostCropVignette}`.
- `pictura_io::xmp::crs` — read/write the `crs:` XMP namespace; lossless-preserve unknown keys.
- `pictura_io::dng` — DNG open/save; embed-or-sidecar policy.
- `pictura_io::psd::smart` — Smart Object wrapping a raw source; editable ACR settings on the embedded object.

Crossing types: `RawFileHandle`, `AcrParams`, `ProcessVersion`, `CameraProfileId`, `LinearImage` / `TileStore`, `XmpPacket`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `AcrDialog` | `QDialog` | Dedicated ACR workspace: filmstrip, preview, tab strip, toolbar, workflow link, Save/Open/Done |
| `AcrTabs` | `QTabWidget` | Hosts Basic, Tone Curve, Detail, HSL/Grayscale, Split Toning, Lens Corrections, Effects, Camera Calibration, Presets, Snapshots |
| `FilmstripModel` / `FilmstripView` | `QAbstractItemModel` / `QListView` | Multi-image selection, rating, sync, mark-for-deletion |
| `HistogramView` | custom `QWidget` | RGB histogram + clipping toggles + RGB readout |
| `ToneCurveWidget` | custom `QWidget` | Parametric region handles + Point curve editing, Targeted Adjustment integration |
| `HslColorRangeModel` | `QAbstractTableModel` | 8 ranges × Hue/Sat/Lum; Grayscale Mix variant |
| `LensCorrectionPanel` | `QWidget` | Profile list, amount sliders, manual transform, CA, vignette, grid (shared with `FILT-101`) |
| `LocalAdjustmentOverlay` | `QQuickWidget` / `QGraphicsView` | On-image brush pins, graduated red/green overlay and handles |
| `AcrPreview` | `QRhiWidget` / `QOpenGLWidget` | GPU preview surface; wgpu shared surface via `ARCH-006` |
| `AcrParamsModel` | `QObject` properties | Two-way binding between controls and `AcrParams`; drives undo |
| `SnapshotListModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | Snapshot create/rename/update/delete |
| `AcrSettingsMenu` | `QMenu` | Save/Load/Reset settings, defaults, local presets |
| `WorkflowOptionsDialog` | `QDialog` | Space/Depth/Size/Resolution/Sharpen For/Smart Objects |

Rationale: panel/tab controls are Widgets (dense, model-driven, keyboard-navigable); the on-canvas overlays and preview are QML/QtQuick for smooth GPU composition. The panel set is shared with the `FILT-101` Lens Correction dialog.

## Data-model impact

- **No new document node in CS6.** ACR edits a *source* (raw/JPEG/TIFF); the result is opened into a layer, or a raw file is opened as a **Smart Object** whose editable settings travel with the object.
- **Settings record:** a versioned `AcrParams` blob stored in one of: sidecar `.XMP` (`crs:` namespace), the ACR database (keyed by file content), or inside a DNG. For the Smart Object path, the settings are the object's editable source settings (`ARCH-008`, `LAY-020`).
- **Undo:** ACR maintains its own in-dialog history/snapshots; Photoshop sees the whole ACR session as a single history step when the object is committed. The integrated model should make each `AcrParams` mutation an undoable command while the dialog is open (`ARCH-009`).
- **Serialization:** round-trip must preserve unknown `crs:` keys and unknown DNG tags byte-for-byte for lossless interop with Adobe and Lightroom (`ARCH-008`, `file-formats.md`).
- **Smart Filters:** the ACR result can be committed into a Smart Object and then masked; ACR itself is not a Smart Filter in CS6.
- **Workflow metadata (Space/Depth/Size/Resolution)** is not stored with the settings (PDF): it is a per-output decision.

## Edge cases

- **CS6 vs CC menu scope** — `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` must not be treated as CS6 parity; if implemented, gate it as an extension.
- **Raw vs JPEG/TIFF** — non-raw files have no camera profile and use the approximate −100…+100 temperature scale; Adobe Standard / Camera Matching profiles are raw-only ("Embedded" appears for TIFF/JPEG).
- **HDR** — ACR 7.1+ opens 16-/24-/32-bit float TIFF/DNG only under PV2012; `Exposure` range expands to ±10; output opens as 8- or 16-bit per Workflow Options.
- **CMYK** — converted to RGB on open.
- **Camera not supported** — decode fails; the UI must report the camera/file as unsupported rather than crash.
- **Lens profile missing / no EXIF** — auto correction unavailable; must fall back to manual, with a clear message (see `FILT-101`).
- **Process-version migration** — opening a PV2010/PV2003 image must not silently change rendering; the user must opt into PV2012 and image appearance should change predictably.
- **Settings storage on read-only media** — ACR cannot write XMP to a read-only volume and falls back to its database; mirror this behavior.
- **Lightroom interop** — ACR reads only primary-image settings, not virtual copies (PDF); preserve this boundary.
- **64-bit/Linux** — ACR's GPU usage must be replaced by wgpu/QRhi; CPU fallback required when no GPU.
- **Very large images / PSB** — 65,000 px / 512 MP ACR ceiling; processing must be tiled/streamed.
- **Memory** — a full-resolution linear float buffer per stage is expensive; use tiled/intermediate caches keyed by params hash.
- **Undo/redo** — committing a multi-hundred-slider session as one Photoshop step must be consistent and reversible.
- **Determinism** — preview and final render must match; the pipeline must not depend on display zoom.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given a supported camera raw file opened from Bridge in a CS6-equivalent, the ACR dialog appears with the full tab set and the Filmstrip when multiple files are selected.
- Given a raw image, setting `Temperature` within 2,000–50,000 K warms/cools the rendered image monotonically; a JPEG/TIFF shows the approximate −100…+100 scale instead.
- Given `Highlight Priority` post-crop vignette with negative `Amount`, corners darken while highlight contrast is preserved relative to `Color Priority` and `Paint Overlay` on the same image.
- Given a click with the White Balance tool on a neutral patch, the resulting display of that patch is neutral within a defined ΔE tolerance.
- Given `Open Image` with `Shift`, the result is a Smart Object layer whose double-click reopens ACR with the saved settings.
- Given a raw file with a matching installed lens profile, enabling profile correction reduces measured distortion/CA/vignetting relative to the uncorrected render, and `Amount` 0/100/200 scales the correction monotonically.
- Given a 32-bit float HDR TIFF in ACR 7.1+ under PV2012, `Exposure` accepts +10…−10 and the output opens as 8- or 16-bit per Workflow Options.
- Given a raw file with sidecar XMP edits made in Lightroom, opening it in ACR shows the same primary-image adjustments (virtual copies excluded).
- Given a CS6 scope check, `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` is absent from the CS6 menu model; if present it is flagged as a post-CS6 extension.
- Given a committed ACR session, one undo returns the layer/object to its pre-ACR state.

Marked inferred/community (not primary): numeric slider ranges absent from the PDF; demosaic/tone/profile internals; the exact ACR 7.1 chromatic-aberration behavior.

## Open questions

- **Filter-menu scope.** Confirm the project treats `Filter > Camera Raw Filter` as a post-CS6 extension. Resolve with a `00-overview/feasibility-and-non-goals.md` decision; the task premise ("introduced CS6") is contradicted by Adobe secondary sources and the CS6 Help PDF.
- **Exact slider ranges/defaults.** The Help PDF does not tabulate numeric ranges. Resolve by reading ACR 7.0's UI metadata or an official ACR 7 reference; every `(community)` value above needs verification.
- **Raw decoding strategy.** Build an in-house decoder or wrap an existing library? This is the single largest scope question. Resolve with a licence/quality/coverage evaluation (and a decision on DNG as the internal raw container).
- **Demosaic parity.** Adobe's demosaic is closed; define whether parity means visual similarity or a specific pixel tolerance, and against which reference demosaicer.
- **PV2012 tone-model parity.** The region definitions, curves, and clipping behavior are closed. Resolve with a reference dataset and measured tolerances, or accept behavioral parity only.
- **Camera profile format.** How are Adobe Standard / Camera Matching profiles stored and evaluated (DCP)? Resolve by parsing an installed profile set; may require a documented third-party implementation.
- **Chromatic-aberration model.** Which CA type(s) ACR 7.1 actually corrects and with what model is not public. Resolve with test images and analysis.
- **Grain synthesis.** The grain generator is closed; define tolerance on grain statistics (spectrum, contrast).
- **HDR float precision.** Whether ACR 7.1 uses `f32` end-to-end or `f16` intermediates affects parity; resolve with a memory/quality study.
- **Third-party plugins.** CS6 ACR also served as a host for camera profiles and the DNG Converter; decide whether the project ships any equivalent.
- **Colour management coupling.** The `Space` menu and the project's ICC/lcms2 pipeline (`ARCH-010`/`color-management.md`) must be reconciled; define the working-space default (PDF suggests ProPhoto RGB as the escape hatch).
