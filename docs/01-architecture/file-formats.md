# File Formats

- **Spec ID:** `ARCH-010` (provisional; see `INDEX.md`)
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (PSD/PSB/TIFF/PNG/JPEG/GIF/BMP); `Extended-only` (EXR/HDR/JPEG 2000/RAW/DNG and the print formats, per edition)
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 documentation lists enhanced OpenEXR support (multi-part/multi-view, high bit depth) and new audio/video container imports; the core still-image set is unchanged from CS5.
- **Depends on:** `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-007` color-management, `10-workflow-io/open-and-new.md`, `10-workflow-io/save-and-save-as.md`, `10-workflow-io/export-formats.md`, `10-workflow-io/web-export-and-slices.md`, `10-workflow-io/camera-raw-workflow.md`, `10-workflow-io/file-info-and-metadata.md`

## CS6 behavior

Photoshop CS6 opens and saves a fixed set of still-image formats. The native
formats (PSD/PSB) are the only ones that round-trip the full document model;
every other format is an import/export boundary that flattens or restricts the
document. Camera raw files open through the Adobe Camera Raw plug-in rather than
the document loader.

The read/write matrix below is the contract. "R/W" means Photoshop documents
both directions for the format; "R" means open/import only. Capabilities such as
layer preservation, alpha, and metadata are per-format.

## Algorithms & pipeline

### PSD/PSB parser and serializer

The native format is specified in `ARCH-008` and the Adobe File Formats
Specification. Key loading concerns for this spec:

- **Section order**: header → color mode data → image resources → layer and mask
  information → image data. Length fields are authoritative; unknown bytes are
  skipped or preserved.
- **Compression codes** for channel data: `0` raw, `1` RLE/PackBits (scanline
  byte counts; 2-byte in PSD, 4-byte in PSB), `2` ZIP without prediction, `3`
  ZIP with prediction. Write RLE by default (Photoshop-compatible) and support
  ZIP on read.
- **Big-endian** byte order on every platform.
- **Opaque preservation**: image-resource blocks (IDs listed in `ARCH-008`),
  unknown additional-layer-information keys, and the duotone spec must be
  retained verbatim so a re-save is lossless even where the engine has no
  semantics.
- **Merged composite** in the image-data section; absent when Maximize
  Compatibility is off.

### TIFF

Photoshop's TIFF is TIFF 6.0 plus private tags. Must handle: multiple
photometric interpretations (RGB, CMYK, Lab, Gray, Indexed, transparency mask),
multiple strips/tiles, LZW/ZIP/JPEG/RLE/PackBits compression, planar vs
interleaved, 8/16-bit samples (32-bit float marked inferred), associated vs
unassociated alpha, ICC/EXIF/IPTC/XMP tags, and Photoshop-specific tags for
layers and resolution. The PSD spec's "Other Document File Formats" chapter
documents Photoshop-specific TIFF tags.

### ZIP-with-prediction

For PSD compression code `3`, the predictor is applied per row before deflate
and inverted after inflate. The exact predictor convention must match
Photoshop's; verify against reference files because this is a common
interoperability failure.

### Metadata extraction

- **EXIF** is parsed with `kamadak-exif` 0.6.1, which reads Exif from TIFF and
  TIFF-based RAW, JPEG, HEIF/HEIC/AVIF, PNG, and WebP.
- **XMP** is an RDF/XML packet; parse/write with an XML crate (for example
  `quick-xml`, candidate) and retain unknown properties.
- **IPTC (IPTC-NAA / IIM)** is stored in PSD image resource 1028 and in
  JPEG/TIFF APP13/IRB; parse and preserve as opaque records when not editing.
- **Color**: ICC bytes per `ARCH-007`.

### Camera RAW and DNG

RAW is not a pixel format: a raw decoder must extract CFA data and metadata, then
a pipeline (demosaic, white balance, color matrix, tone) converts to RGB. CS6
delegates this to Camera Raw. For Kooka Pictura, `rawler`/`libraw-rs` are
candidates for CFA extraction (`rawler::RawImage` exposes image data plus CFA
config and black level); the demosaic/develop pipeline is a separate spec
(`10-workflow-io/camera-raw-workflow.md`). DNG is a TIFF/EP-based container, so
the TIFF layer plus a DNG tag reader is a viable route.

### Vector formats (PDF/EPS)

PDF open rasterizes pages via a renderer; PDF save writes the flattened (or
layer-preserved) image plus text/vector where supported. EPS is PostScript;
useful EPS features are the embedded TIFF/JPEG preview, the clipping path
(PSD image resource 2999 naming, `ARCH-008`), and Photoshop's EPS options.
Rasterizing PostScript reliably on Linux implies an external engine
(Ghostscript) unless a pure-Rust interpreter is adopted; this is a design
decision, not a sourced CS6 fact.

### HDR formats (OpenEXR, Radiance)

Both are float RGB. OpenEXR should use the `exr` crate. Radiance HDR uses RGBE
encoding (`image::codecs::hdr`). Open in 32-bit mode; document color management
(`ARCH-007`) applies.

## Rust module mapping

Proposals. A dispatcher selects a codec by signature (not extension) and returns
a common `DecodedImage`/`EncodeRequest`.

- `pictura_io::detect` — signature sniffing (`image::guess_format`, plus custom
  PSD/PSB `8BPS` and PDF `%PDF` checks).
- `pictura_io::psd` — the only format that maps to/from the full document
  model; thin wrapper over `pictura_core::psd`.
- `pictura_io::raster` — a uniform interface over `image` codecs (PNG, JPEG,
  GIF, BMP, TIFF, PNM, TGA, HDR, EXR) and specialized encoders where quality
  matters (`jpeg-encoder`, `imagequant`).
- `pictura_io::tiff` — TIFF options (compression, layers, depth) over `tiff`.
- `pictura_io::jpeg2000` — `jpeg2k` wrapper.
- `pictura_io::pdf` — write via `printpdf`/`lopdf`; import via an external
  renderer adapter (Ghostscript/Poppler).
- `pictura_io::eps` — write PostScript directly or via a `postscript` crate
  (candidate); import via the same external renderer adapter.
- `pictura_io::raw` — `rawler`/`libraw-rs` adapter producing CFA + metadata.
- `pictura_io::iff` — `iff`/`oxideav-iff` (candidate) ILBM reader.
- `pictura_io::metadata` — EXIF (`kamadak-exif`), XMP (XML), IPTC (opaque).
- `pictura_io::color` — ICC embed/extract via `pictura_color`.

Types crossing boundaries: `DecodedImage { width, height, depth: BitDepth,
mode: ColorMode, planes: PlaneData, metadata: Metadata, profile: Option<Vec<u8>> }`
and `EncodeRequest` with per-format option enums. Raw returns
`RawImage { cfa, black_level, white_level, camera_wb, metadata }` instead.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `OpenDialog` | `QFileDialog` | Format filter from the matrix; "Camera Raw" routing |
| `SaveAsDialog` | `QDialog` | Format combo, per-format option pane, "Embed Color Profile", "Use Proof Setup / ICC" |
| `TiffOptionsWidget` | `QWidget` | Compression, byte order, layers, transparency |
| `JpegOptionsWidget` | `QWidget` | Quality, format, subsampling, preview size |
| `GifOptionsWidget` | `QWidget` | Palette, dither, transparency, matte |
| `PdfOptionsWidget` | `QWidget` | Preset/standard, layers, compression, output intent |
| `CameraRawDialog` | `QDialog` | ACR-style develop settings before opening |
| `MetadataDialog` | `QDialog` | EXIF/IPTC/XMP pages (`ARCH-008`) |
| `FileFormatModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | Extensions, direction flags, and option factories |

Directory placement and dialogs are shared with `02-ui-ux` and
`10-workflow-io/save-and-save-as.md`.

## Data-model impact

- Importing a non-native format creates a document in a compatible color mode
  and bit depth and, where the format carries them, populates metadata, ICC
  profile, alpha channels (as alpha or transparency), paths (TIFF clipping
  path), and animation frames (GIF).
- Exporting a non-native format flattens or restricts per the matrix. The export
  must not mutate the in-memory document; it works from a snapshot.
- The file-format choice and per-format options are persisted per document in a
  non-serialized "save settings" record (not written to the file).
- Unknown metadata and unknown PSD blocks are preserved for lossless native
  round-trip.
- PSD/PSB save uses the Document serializer in `ARCH-008`; bit-depth and mode are
  document fields, not format options.

## Edge cases

- **Extension vs content** — detect by signature; a `.jpg` that is a PSD must
  open correctly, and a mislabeled file must not be trusted.
- **PSB > 30,000 px** — 8-byte length fields; TIFF/PNG/JPEG size limits differ.
- **CMYK JPEG** — 4-component JPEG uses Adobe APP14 conventions; handle
  inverted-CMYK quirk on read.
- **16-bit PNG** — supported; 16-bit GIF/JPEG are not. Convert or reject per
  format rather than silently truncating.
- **PNG palette + alpha** — indexed with transparency; quantization on save via
  `imagequant`.
- **GIF animation** — multiple frames and delays; document model support is out
  of core scope (timeline spec).
- **TIFF tile/strip variants** — both must be read; write strips for
  compatibility.
- **TIFF CMYK + ICC** — honor the embedded profile; do not assume a default.
- **PostScript without a renderer** — EPS/PDF import fails gracefully; do not
  crash on missing Ghostscript.
- **RAW without a decoder match** — camera unsupported: surface the camera model
  and offer to open as generic TIFF if applicable.
- **DNG variants** — linear DNG has demosaiced channels; non-linear carries CFA.
- **OpenEXR deep/multi-part data** — CS6 added multi-part/multi-view; the `exr`
  crate may not expose every feature; degrade gracefully.
- **Huge files** — stream/tile; avoid loading a multi-GB TIFF into one
  allocation.
- **Metadata round-trip** — preserve unknown EXIF/IPTC/XMP fields byte-for-byte
  where possible; note that not all formats can carry all metadata.
- **Endianness** — TIFF and PSD byte order and PSB 8-byte fields.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given a PSD saved by CS6 with layers, masks, styles, paths, ICC, EXIF, XMP, and
  IPTC, opening and re-saving in Kooka Pictura preserves all fields and unknown
  blocks; the composite is visually identical within tolerance.
- Given a PSB with dimensions above 30,000 px, open/save round-trips without
  truncation.
- Given RLE, ZIP, and ZIP-with-prediction PSD layer channels, decode matches the
  raw channel data bit-exactly.
- Given a TIFF with LZW, ZIP, JPEG, and RLE compression, 8- and 16-bit samples,
  and CMYK/RGB/Lab/Gray photometric modes, each decodes correctly and the ICC
  profile is honored.
- Given a PNG at 8- and 16-bit with and without alpha, decode/encode round-trips
  losslessly and preserves the iCCP profile when present.
- Given a baseline, progressive, and CMYK JPEG, decode succeeds and metadata is
  extracted; re-encode at quality Q matches a reference within the defined PSNR
  tolerance.
- Given a GIF with 256 colors and transparency, decode yields the correct
  palette and frame; save with `imagequant` meets the palette tolerance.
- Given a 32-bit EXR and a Radiance HDR file, each opens in 32-bit mode with
  correct float values within 1 ULP after round-trip.
- Given a JPEG 2000 codestream (`.j2k`) and JP2 container, decode succeeds and an
  encode/decode round-trip meets the quality tolerance.
- Given a Camera Raw file supported by ACR 7, the raw adapter extracts CFA data
  and the core metadata (camera, ISO, exposure) without error.
- Given a DNG, both linear and non-linear variants are detected and handled.
- Given a PBM/PGM/PPM, IFF/ILBM, and TGA file, open succeeds; TGA re-saves.
- Given metadata in any supported format, File Info displays EXIF/IPTC/XMP and a
  save preserves fields the format can carry.
- Given a mislabeled file (extension != content), the correct decoder is chosen
  by signature.
- Given Ghostscript is absent, attempting to open a PDF/EPS reports a clear error
  and does not crash.

## Open questions

- **CS6 read/write matrix.** The direction and capability cells are largely
  *(inferred)*. Resolve by parsing the CS6 support-list PDF above or the CS6 Help
  PDF, and by testing CS6 Save As/open dialogs.
- **TIFF capabilities.** Whether CS6 saves layers, 32-bit float, and which
  compression schemes by default is unconfirmed. Resolve from the CS6 Help PDF
  and CS6-made TIFFs.
- **PDF import/export fidelity.** Which PDF features survive Photoshop's open
  (layers, vector, text) and which export presets exist is not sourced. Resolve
  from the CS6 Help PDF (`Save As PDF`).
- **EPS generation and rasterization.** The exact EPS options and the
  PostScript-interpreter strategy on Linux (Ghostscript vs a pure-Rust engine)
  are open. Resolve with a spike and licensing review.
- **JPEG 2000 options and depth.** CS6's J2K quality controls and 16-bit support
  are unconfirmed. Resolve from the CS6 Help PDF.
- **OpenEXR write support.** Whether CS6 saves EXR (versus read-only) and which
  channels/compressions it emits is unconfirmed. Resolve from the CS6 Help PDF.
- **Radiance HDR write support.** Same question as OpenEXR. Resolve from the CS6
  Help PDF.
- **PBM/PGM/PPM and IFF write support.** Whether Photoshop offers a Save As for
  these is unconfirmed; the matrix assumes read-only. Resolve from the CS6 Help
  PDF.
- **BMP and TGA option sets.** Exact depth/alpha/RLE options per CS6 need
  confirmation.
- **Metadata carriage per format.** Which of EXIF/IPTC/XMP each format can carry
  in CS6, and what is stripped, needs confirmation.
- **Camera Raw coverage.** The last ACR for CS6 is reported as 9.1.1 in
  community sources; the exact camera list and DNG conversion options are not
  sourced. Resolve in `10-workflow-io/camera-raw-workflow.md`.
- **Crate gaps.** There is no mature Rust PSD *writer* and no mature pure-Rust
  PostScript interpreter; both are build-vs-bind decisions. Resolve in
  `00-overview/feasibility-and-non-goals.md` and `licensing-and-independent-creation.md`.
