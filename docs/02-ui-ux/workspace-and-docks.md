# Workspace and Docks

- **Spec ID:** `UI-003`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — the Application bar was removed and the workspace switcher moved into the **Options bar** (top-right, directly above the panel columns); CS6 ships the predefined workspaces `Essentials (Default)`, `New in CS6`, `3D`, `Advanced 3D` (Extended), `Motion`, `Painting`, `Photography` and `Typography`; a darker interface with **four brightness themes** and `Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels` shape dock behavior.
- **Depends on:** `UI-001` application-frame, `UI-002` menus, `ARCH-003` qt6-ui-design, `01-architecture/document-model.md`

## CS6 behavior

### Panels and panel groups

- A **panel** is a dockable module (Layers, Color, History, …). Panels can be
  **grouped, stacked, or docked**. A **panel group** is several panels sharing
  one title bar, switched by their tabs.
- Each panel has a **tab** (with its name) and a **panel title bar** — the solid
  empty bar above the tabs. The **panel menu** icon sits at the **upper-right**
  corner of the panel and opens even when the panel is minimised.
- The **Window** menu lists every panel (plus `Window > Options` for the options
  bar). A checkmark means the panel is open **and active** in its group — a panel
  nested behind another active tab is open but unmarked. The complete CS6 panel
  inventory (Help reference; *Adobe Photoshop CS6 for Photographers*):

| Panel | CS6 notes |
|---|---|
| 3D | Photoshop Extended |
| Actions | |
| Adjustments | adjustment-layer launcher; its CS5 adjustment-controls mode moved to Properties |
| Animation | frame-by-frame animation; the Help also documents a Timeline mode |
| Brush | |
| Brush Presets | |
| Channels | |
| Character | |
| Character Styles | |
| Clone Source | |
| Color | |
| Histogram | |
| History | |
| Info | |
| Layer Comps | |
| Layers | |
| Measurement Log | Photoshop Extended |
| Mini Bridge | `Window > Extensions > Mini Bridge` |
| Navigator | |
| Notes | new panel in CS6 |
| Options | `Window > Options` (options bar, not a dock panel) |
| Paragraph | |
| Paragraph Styles | |
| Paths | |
| Properties | new in CS6; absorbs the former Adjustments-controls mode and the CS5 Masks panel |
| Styles | |
| Swatches | |
| Timeline | clip-based video timeline (CS6 redesign) |
| Tool Presets | |
| Tools | Tools-panel visibility toggle |

- **Not CS6 panels:** `Libraries` (introduced Photoshop CC 2014), `Gradients`,
  `Patterns` and `Shapes` (all three added in Photoshop 2020/v21), and `Masks`
  (CS4–CS5, folded into Properties in CS6). The task brief's
  `Properties/Adjustments/Libraries` grouping is not a CS6 arrangement.
- Default CS6 **Essentials** layout: two columns on the right. The wider
  **main column** holds three stacked groups — `Color|Swatches`,
  `Adjustments|Styles`, `Layers|Channels|Paths`. The narrower **secondary
  column** to its left is collapsed to icons — `History` and `Properties`. The
  official Adobe CS6 Project 1 guide additionally shows `Mini Bridge` and
  `Timeline` docked beneath the document window (see Open questions).
- The **workspace switcher** sits at the top-right of the window, at the right
  end of the **Options bar**, immediately above the panel columns.
- CS6 added **panel text font size** (`Interface > UI Font Size`, Small/Medium/Large,
  applied after relaunch), **Enable Text Drop Shadows**, and **on-image displays**.
  The interface offers **four colour themes** (brightness levels; the default is
  dark) selected as swatches in the Interface preferences, and the canvas colour
  is chosen per screen mode. `Shift+F1` darkens and `Shift+F2` lightens the theme
  (the CS6 Help body also prints `Shift+1`/`Shift+2` for the same action).

### Docking, floating, and moving

- A **dock** is a collection of panels/groups, generally vertical. Create a dock
  by dragging panels to an edge until a **drop zone** appears.
- **Dock a panel:** drag it by its tab to the top, bottom, or between panels.
  **Dock a group:** drag it by its title bar.
- **Undock/float:** drag a panel or group out by its tab/title bar, into another
  dock, or free-floating.
- While moving, **blue highlighted drop zones** appear. The *pointer* position
  activates a drop zone, not the panel position (important UX detail).
- **Prevent docking:** hold `Ctrl` (Windows) / `Cmd` (Mac) while moving a panel.
  **Cancel:** press `Esc` while moving.
- **Stack floating panels:** drag a panel's tab to the drop zone at the bottom of
  another panel; reorder by dragging tabs up/down. Release on the narrow zone
  between panels, not the broad title-bar zone.
- A dock need not fill its column — drag the dock's bottom edge up so it stops
  short of the workspace edge.
- **Reorder within a group:** drag a panel's tab left/right; **add to a group:**
  drop on the highlighted group border; **remove from a group:** drag the tab out.
- If all panels are removed from a dock, the dock disappears.

### Tabs, minimizing, resizing

- **Minimise/maximise** a panel, group or stack: double-click a tab (or the empty
  tab area). Double-clicking a tab minimises the group; a single click on a tab
  maximises it again.
- **Resize** a panel by dragging any side. Some panels, such as the Color panel,
  cannot be resized by dragging; the full exception set is unknown (see Open
  questions).
- **Collapse/expand a group:** click its tab; the tab toggles the group.
- **Close a panel:** right-click (`Ctrl`-click on Mac) its tab → `Close`, or
  deselect it in the `Window` menu. **Close a whole group:** panel menu →
  `Close Tab Group`. **Add a panel:** select it from the `Window` menu; reopening
  restores the group and position it had before it was closed.

### Collapsing to icons

- Panels can be **collapsed to icons** to reduce clutter. Collapse/expand all
  icons in a column with the **double arrow at the top of the dock** (top-right
  of the column). In some default workspaces the secondary column already ships
  collapsed to icons.
- Expand a single icon by clicking it. Resize the dock narrower until labels
  disappear to show icons only; widen to show labels again.
- Collapse an expanded panel back to its icon by clicking its tab, its icon, or
  the double arrow in the panel's title bar.
- `Interface > Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels` (CS6 label; the Help body writes
  "Auto-Collapse Icon Panels") collapses an expanded icon panel when the user
  clicks away. It can also be toggled by right-clicking a panel tab.
- Add a floating panel/group to an **icon dock** by dragging it in; panels added
  to an icon dock are automatically collapsed to icons.
- Move a panel icon (or icon group) by dragging the icon: up/down within a dock,
  into another dock (it adopts that dock's style), or outside (floating icon).

### Hiding panels

- `Tab` hides/shows **all** panels including the Tools panel and options bar;
  `Shift+Tab` hides/shows all panels **except** the Tools panel and options bar.
- With `Interface > Auto-Show Hidden Panels` selected, hovering the edge of the
  application window (Windows) or monitor (Mac) shows the hidden panels
  temporarily.
- `Window > Options` shows/hides the options bar.

### Workspace presets

A **workspace** is a named panel arrangement. CS6 ships predefined workspaces and
lets users create their own. In CS6 the **Application bar was removed**, so the
workspace switcher now lives at the right end of the **Options bar** (top-right
of the window, directly above the panel columns); document-layout options moved
to `Window > Arrange`.

| Workspace | Status in CS6 | Panel set |
|---|---|---|
| Essentials (Default) | Confirmed default | Main column: `Color\|Swatches`, `Adjustments\|Styles`, `Layers\|Channels\|Paths`; secondary icon column: `History`, `Properties` |
| New in CS6 | Confirmed | Marks new features/commands throughout the menus (highlight colour unverified) |
| 3D | Confirmed | 3D-oriented panels (Photoshop Extended) |
| Advanced 3D | Confirmed (Help PDF, `Window > Workspace > Advanced 3D`) | Extended 3D panel set |
| Motion | Confirmed | Video/animation (`Timeline`) |
| Painting | Confirmed | Replaces Color→`Navigator` and Adjustments/Styles→`Brush Presets`; adds `Brush`, `Clone Source`, `Tool Presets`; keeps `History`, `Layers\|Channels\|Paths` |
| Photography | Confirmed | Adds `Histogram`, `Info`, `Actions` to the general photo panels |
| Typography | Confirmed | Type panels (`Character`, `Paragraph`, `Character Styles`, `Paragraph Styles`) |
| Design | **Not in CS6** | Later CC workspace — no CS6 source lists it; CS6 sources name `Typography` instead |

`New in CS6` is a helper workspace that highlights the new CS6 commands in the
menus.

### Save, switch, delete, reset

- **Save:** `Window > Workspace > New Workspace…` (or `New Workspace` from the
  switcher); enter a name; optionally **Capture** `Keyboard Shortcuts` and
  `Menus` (both Photoshop). Saved names appear in both the workspace switcher
  and the `Window > Workspace` menu.
- **Switch:** choose a workspace from the switcher (or `Window > Workspace >`).
  The same document can be shown in any workspace. The switcher also carries
  `New Workspace`, `Delete Workspace` and `Reset [Workspace]` entries.
- **Delete:** `Window > Workspace > Delete Workspace…` (choose from the switcher)
  and confirm.
- **Reset one workspace:** `Window > Workspace > Reset [Workspace Name]`.
- **Restore all built-ins:** `Interface > Restore Default Workspaces`.
- **Reorder** workspaces by dragging them in the switcher.
- Workspaces remember panel positions as you last left them until reset —
  switching away and back does **not** restore the saved arrangement
  automatically; the explicit `Reset` does.

## Algorithms & pipeline

Design proposal.

- **`QDockWidget` is the panel primitive.** Each panel is a `QDockWidget` with a
  custom title bar (`setTitleBarWidget`) so the title bar, tabs and collapse
  arrow match CS6. Grouping is achieved with `QMainWindow::tabifyDockWidget` and
  a shared tab bar; stacking/floating uses `Qt::Floating` `QDockWidget`s whose
  geometry is restored per workspace.
- **Dock model.** In CS6 a *dock* is a vertical column that stacks one or more
  panel *groups*; a group is a tabbed set. Model this as a `QMainWindow` dock
  area holding several tabified `QDockWidget`s, not as Qt nested docks.
- **Four dock areas + optional nesting.** Default `DockOptions`:
  `AnimatedDocks | AllowTabbedDocks`, and **not** `AllowNestedDocks` (keep drag
  semantics simple, per `ARCH-003`).
- **Drop-zone resolution.** On drag-move, compute nearest dock edge / inter-panel
  gap; honour the modifier that suppresses docking (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`) and `Esc`
  cancel. Use the *cursor* position, matching the documented CS6 behavior.
- **Icon collapse.** A dock can be in `Expanded` or `Icon` mode. Collapse all =
  iterate dock widgets and switch to icon mode (title bar only / vertical tab
  strip). Widen/narrow the dock to show/hide labels. `Auto-Collapse Iconic
  Panels` collapses on focus loss.
- **Workspace model.** A workspace is
  `{ name, layout: QByteArray (saveState), panelWidths, iconMode[], activeTabs[],
  capturedShortcutSet?, capturedMenuSet? }`. `saveState()` keys by
  `objectName`, so every dockable panel needs a stable, unique `objectName`.
- **Apply/reset.** `apply(workspace)` calls `restoreState` + panel widths + icon
  modes. `reset(workspace)` restores the *factory* layout stored at build time,
  because CS6 remembers the last-used arrangement between switches.
- **Hide-all.** `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` animate tray hiding of docks; with
  `Auto-Show Hidden Panels`, an edge hover re-shows them.

## Rust module mapping

Proposals.

- `pictura_ui::workspace::Workspace` — name, serialized layout, panel widths,
  icon modes, active tabs, optional captured shortcut/menu sets.
- `pictura_ui::workspace::Registry` — built-in and user workspaces; resolve
  duplicate names; ordering.
- `pictura_ui::workspace::persist` — save/restore against the session/preference
  store; versioned schema so layout persists across releases.
- `pictura_ui::docks::PanelId` — stable ids matching `objectName`s.
- `pictura_ui::docks::IconState` — expanded/icon per dock, animation policy.

Crossing types: `WorkspaceName`, `PanelId`, `QByteArray` layout blob opaque to
Rust (or an equivalent neutral layout description), widths as `f32` DIP. No
document data.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `PicturaMainWindow` | `QMainWindow` | Owns dock areas; `saveState`/`restoreState`; `setDockOptions` |
| `PicturaDock` | `QDockWidget` | Panel host; custom `PanelHeader` title bar; `toggleViewAction` |
| `PanelHeader` | `QWidget` | Title, tab strip, panel-menu button, collapse arrow, drag hints |
| `WorkspaceSwitcher` | `QComboBox`/button+menu | Lists workspaces; New/Delete/Reset entries |
| `WorkspaceController` | `QObject` | Apply/reset/save/delete; persists session layout |
| `IconDockController` | `QObject` | Collapse/expand icon columns, label-width threshold, auto-collapse |

`saveState()`/`restoreState()` require every `QDockWidget` and toolbar to have a
unique `objectName` before the first restore; enforce this at registration.
Nested docks are disabled by default, so `saveState()` output is simpler and more
stable across Qt versions.

## Data-model impact

- Workspace/layout is **UI state**, stored in the preference/session store and
  optionally captured into a workspace; never in PSD/XMP.
- A workspace may capture **keyboard shortcut and menu customisation sets**
  (`UI-002`); those are preference records referenced by name.
- Restoring a workspace must not mutate the document model or add history
  states. Panel visibility toggles likewise produce no history.
- Panel content (Layers/Channels/Paths/History) is a **view over the document
  model**; the panel owns no document data (`ARCH-003`).

## Edge cases

- **Wayland.** Dock/floating geometry is compositor-controlled; restore relative
  layout only, never absolute positions.
- **Multi-monitor float.** A floated panel/group must be clamped to available
  geometry on restore; screen geometry is DIP with scaling gaps.
- **High-DPI change.** Icon assets and dock metrics rebuild when
  `devicePixelRatio` changes; persisted pixel widths should be stored as DIP.
- **Many panels.** Tabification plus deep nesting can exceed screen space; keep
  `AllowNestedDocks` off and provide overflow/scroll.
- **Duplicate `objectName`.** Breaks `restoreState` silently; registration must
  reject duplicates.
- **User workspace name collision** with a built-in (`Essentials`) must be
  prevented or namespaced.
- **Deleted/corrupt layout blob.** Fall back to Essentials and keep the user's
  custom workspaces intact.
- **Panel removed by a future version.** Restoring an old layout must ignore
  unknown panel ids without dropping the rest.
- **Screen mode interacts with docks** — entering Full Screen hides docks; the
  layout must survive the round trip.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given the default Essentials workspace, the main column contains
  `Color|Swatches`, `Adjustments|Styles` and `Layers|Channels|Paths`, and the
  secondary column contains `History` and `Properties` collapsed to icons.
- Given two panels in one dock, dragging a tab above/below another re-docks it
  with a blue drop zone snapped to the pointer; holding `Ctrl`/`Cmd` and dropping
  floats it; pressing `Esc` mid-drag cancels.
- Given a floating panel dragged to the bottom of another floating panel, they
  stack and move together as a unit; dragging one out un-stacks it.
- Given a dock, clicking the top double arrow collapses all its panels to icons
  and clicking again expands them; widening past the label threshold shows names.
- Given `Tab`, all panels including the Tools panel and options bar hide; given
  `Shift+Tab`, the Tools panel and options bar remain; with `Auto-Show Hidden
  Panels` on, hovering the screen edge reveals them.
- Given a rearranged layout, `Window > Workspace > New Workspace…` with Capture
  `Keyboard Shortcuts` saves it; selecting it later restores layout plus
  shortcuts; `Delete Workspace` removes it after confirmation.
- Given a modified built-in workspace, `Reset Essentials` restores the factory
  arrangement; `Restore Default Workspaces` restores every built-in.
- Given the `Window` menu, each panel's entry toggles its visibility;
  right-clicking its tab offers `Close`, and the panel menu offers
  `Close Tab Group`.
- Given a saved workspace and a restart at the same scale factor, the layout,
  panel widths, icon modes and active tabs restore within one pixel.
- Given `devicePixelRatio = 2`, restored widths and icons are crisp and correct.

## Open questions

- **Exact workspace-switcher order.** The workspace *set* is confirmed
  (`Essentials (Default)`, `New in CS6`, `3D`, `Advanced 3D`, `Motion`,
  `Painting`, `Photography`, `Typography`), but the on-screen ordering in the
  switcher has not been captured. Resolve with a switcher screenshot.
- **`New in CS6` highlight colour.** The Help only says new features are
  highlighted in the menus; the exact colour is unverified.
- **Mini Bridge / Timeline in default Essentials.** The official CS6 Project 1
  guide shows `Mini Bridge` and `Timeline` docked beneath the document window,
  while the detailed CS6 panel tutorial describes only the two right-hand
  columns. Confirm which reflects a clean first-run Essentials.
- **Precise dock metrics.** Icon dock width, label-hide threshold, tab height,
  title-bar height are unsourced. Resolve with pixel measurements from a CS6
  screenshot.
- **Nested docks in CS6.** CS6 docks are columns of stacked tab groups, not Qt
  nested docks; whether a group could be split inside one column beyond
  stacking is not fully verified. Our proposal disables `AllowNestedDocks`.
- **Layout persistence format.** CS6's workspace serialization is proprietary;
  we store our own versioned blob. Cross-version migration policy is open.
- **Panel resize exceptions.** The Help says "some panels, such as the Color
  panel, cannot be resized"; the full exception set is unknown. Resolve with a
  CS6 interaction pass.
- **Auto-Collapse / Auto-Show defaults.** Defaults are inferred (both off).
  Resolve with a first-run CS6 preferences capture.
- **Brightness shortcut discrepancy.** The CS6 Help prints both
  `Shift+F1`/`Shift+F2` (What's New) and `Shift+1`/`Shift+2` (workspace body);
  confirm which the shipping CS6 build uses on each platform.
