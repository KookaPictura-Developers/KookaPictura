# Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Spec ID:** `UI-011`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (shortcut *editing* and *sets* are Core; some dialog shortcuts cover
  Extended-only features and are `Extended-only` where noted).
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 keeps the CS5 shortcut engine and default set but changes
  several defaults and adds shortcuts for new features (Crop-tool overlay keys, Blur Gallery
  `H`/`M`, Liquify `M`/`X`, Adaptive Wide Angle constraint keys, Print `Space`), adds
  `00`/`Shift+00` layer opacity, adds Type-tool dynamic shortcuts, and moves the Type menu.
  CS6 also promotes `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` (and `Window > Workspace > Keyboard Shortcuts &
  Menus`) as the shortcut editor, with exportable sets and an HTML **Summarize** report.
- **Depends on:** `02-ui-ux/preferences.md` (`UI-010`), `02-ui-ux/accessibility.md` (`UI-012`),
  `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md`, `03-tools/*`, `02-ui-ux/panels/timeline-panel.md`
  (`Enable Timeline Shortcut Keys`).

> Module/type names are design proposals. The shortcut tables below are transcribed from the
> CS6 Help reference and cross-checked against a complete CS6 shortcut sheet. No table rows
> remain unverified; the residual open items are listed under Open questions.

## CS6 behavior

Photoshop CS6 ships a large default shortcut set plus a full shortcut editor. Help states:
"Photoshop lets you view a list of all shortcuts, and edit or create shortcuts. The Keyboard
Shortcuts dialog box serves as a shortcut editor, and includes all commands that support
shortcuts, some of which aren't addressed in the default shortcut set."

### Shortcut editing and saved sets

- **Open the editor:** `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts`, or
  `Window > Workspace > Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus` → **Keyboard Shortcuts** tab.
- **Set menu:** choose a set; sets are named (a `Photoshop Defaults` set plus user sets).
- **Shortcuts For menu:**
  - **Application Menus** — menu-bar items.
  - **Panel Menus** — panel fly-out menus.
  - **Tools** — toolbox tools.
- **Assign:** select the row, type a new shortcut. If it conflicts, an alert offers **Accept**
  (steals the shortcut), **Undo Changes**, or **Accept and Go To Conflict**.
- **Save / Save Set As / Undo / Use Default / Cancel** buttons manage the current set. Saving
  over `Photoshop Defaults` opens a Save dialog to name a new set.
- **Delete Shortcut** removes one binding; the **Delete icon** removes a whole set.
- **Summarize** exports the current set to an HTML file for display/printing.
- **Workspaces:** "In Photoshop, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to each workspace to navigate
  among them quickly." (`Window > Workspace`).
- **Legacy channel shortcuts:** `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` → **Use Legacy Channel Shortcuts**
  switches channel keys between `Ctrl/Command+1` (new default) and `Alt/Option+1` (legacy).
- **Menu customization:** the same dialog's **Menus** tab can set menu-item visibility and
  colors ("Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus").
- `Preferences > General > Use Shift Key For Tool Switch` changes how grouped tool shortcuts
  cycle (see `UI-010`).

### New-in-CS6 feature shortcuts

From the CS6 Help "Key shortcuts for new CS6 features":

**Print:** hold `Space` while choosing `File > Print` to clear print settings.

**Blur Gallery (Field, Iris, Tilt-Shift):** `H` temporarily hides on-canvas UI; `M` temporarily
shows the blur mask.

**Liquify:** `M` loads the last mesh; `X` selects the Mirror tool.

**Crop tool:**

| Result | Windows | Mac OS |
|---|---|---|
| Commit crop | Double-click inside crop box, or `Enter` | Double-click, or `Return` |
| Cancel crop | `Esc` | `Esc` |
| Switch crop-box orientation portrait ↔ landscape | `X` | `X` |
| Front Image (Creative Cloud only) | `I` | `I` |
| Reset crop box | `Backspace`/`Delete` | `Backspace`/`Delete` |
| Cycle overlay options | `O` | `O` |
| Cycle overlay orientation (Triangle, Golden Spiral) | `Shift+O` | `Shift+O` |
| Hide/show cropped area | `/` | `/` |
| Create new crop box | `Shift+drag` | `Shift+drag` |
| Constrain proportions | `Shift+drag` corner handle | `Shift+drag` corner handle |
| Invoke Straighten tool | `Control` | `Command` |
| Prevent crop box from shrinking | `Control+rotate` | `Command+rotate` |
| Restrict to 15° increments | `Shift+rotate` | `Shift+rotate` |
| Restrict to 45° axes | `Shift+drag` image | `Shift+drag` image |
| Temporarily disable snapping to edge | `Control+drag` | `Command+drag` |

**Adaptive Wide Angle — tool shortcuts:** `C` Constraint, `Y` Polygon Constraint, `M` Move,
`H` Hand, `Z` Zoom. **Control shortcuts:** `P` Preview, `W` Show Constraint, `E` Show Mesh,
`T` Correction, `S` Scale, `F` Focal Length, `R` Crop Factor, `A` As Shot. **Hidden:** `L`
toggle transparent matte, `X` temporary zoom, `E` revert last polygon corner.

### Tool shortcuts (default set)

Holding a key temporarily activates a tool; releasing returns to the previous tool. Rows with
multiple tools share one letter — repeatedly press, or `Shift`+letter when **Use Shift Key for
Tool Switch** is on. `Alt/Option`-click a tool cycles its hidden tools (except add-anchor-point,
delete-anchor-point, convert-point).

| Tool (cycle with the letter) | Windows | Mac OS |
|---|---|---|
| Move | `V` | `V` |
| Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee | `M` | `M` |
| Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, Magnetic Lasso | `L` | `L` |
| Quick Selection, Magic Wand | `W` | `W` |
| Crop, Perspective Crop, Slice, Slice Select | `C` | `C` |
| Eyedropper, Color Sampler, Ruler, Note, Count\*, 3D Material Eyedropper\* | `I` | `I` |
| Spot Healing Brush, Healing Brush, Patch, Content-Aware Move, Red Eye | `J` | `J` |
| Brush, Pencil, Color Replacement, Mixer Brush | `B` | `B` |
| Clone Stamp, Pattern Stamp | `S` | `S` |
| History Brush, Art History Brush | `Y` | `Y` |
| Eraser, Background Eraser, Magic Eraser | `E` | `E` |
| Gradient, Paint Bucket, 3D Material Drop\* | `G` | `G` |
| Dodge, Burn, Sponge | `O` | `O` |
| Pen, Freeform Pen | `P` | `P` |
| Horizontal Type, Vertical Type, Horizontal Type Mask, Vertical Type Mask | `T` | `T` |
| Path Selection, Direct Selection | `A` | `A` |
| Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Line, Custom Shape | `U` | `U` |
| 3D Object Rotate/Roll/Pan/Slide/Scale* | `K` | `K` |
| 3D Camera Rotate/Roll/Pan/Walk/Zoom* | `N` | `N` |
| Hand | `H` | `H` |
| Rotate View | `R` | `R` |
| Zoom | `Z` | `Z` |

`*` Photoshop Extended only. "Cycle through hidden tools" methods and the shared-letter groups
are also documented in the CS6 Help; the exact per-row `Alt`/`Shift` phrasing is in the full map
below (`Keys for selecting tools`).

### Brush size, hardness, and toolbox keys

| Result | Windows | Mac OS |
|---|---|---|
| Decrease/increase brush size | `[` / `]` | `[` / `]` |
| Decrease/increase brush hardness | `Shift+[` / `Shift+]` | `Shift+[` / `Shift+]` |
| Select previous/next brush preset | `,` / `.` | `,` / `.` |
| Select first/last brush preset | `Shift+,` / `Shift+.` | `Shift+,` / `Shift+.` |
| Restore default foreground/background colours | `D` | `D` |
| Swap foreground/background colours | `X` | `X` |
| Toggle Standard mode / Quick Mask mode | `Q` | `Q` |
| Toggle screen modes (forward / backward) | `F` / `Shift+F` | `F` / `Shift+F` |
| Toggle canvas colour (forward / backward) | `Space+F` / `Space+Shift+F` | `Space+F` / `Space+Shift+F` |

`[` / `]` and `Shift+[` / `Shift+]` come from the CS6 shortcut sheet; the CS6
Help documents the same keys inside individual dialogs (Liquify, Vanishing
Point, Camera Raw) and the Brush panel.

### Dynamic shortcuts (type)

Dynamic shortcuts exist only while entering/editing type or when type is selected, and are
listed in the Character panel menu when available. Examples include Faux Bold/Italic, All Caps,
Small Caps, superscript/subscript, underline/strikethrough, and the standard text-editing keys.
`Type > Font Preview Size` (moved to the Type menu in CS6) is not a dynamic shortcut but a menu
option.

The full default map, by category, follows below. It is the CS6 Help "Default keyboard
shortcuts" section; `†` and `*` footnote the original help (same key used in Liquify; Extended
only). The function-key `Undo/Redo` row and the tool rows for CS6's new tools
(Content-Aware Move, Perspective Crop, 3D Material Eyedropper/Drop) were cross-checked against
the CS6 shortcut sheet.

### Function keys

| Result | Windows | Mac OS |
|---|---|---|
| Start Help | F1 | Help key |
| Undo/Redo | — (`Ctrl+Z`) | F1 |
| Cut | F2 | F2 |
| Copy | F3 | F3 |
| Paste | F4 | F4 |
| Show/Hide Brush panel | F5 | F5 |
| Show/Hide Color panel | F6 | F6 |
| Show/Hide Layers panel | F7 | F7 |
| Show/Hide Info panel | F8 | F8 |

| Revert | F12 | F12 |
| Fill | Shift + F5 | Shift + F5 |
| Feather Selection | Shift + F6 | Shift + F6 |
| Inverse Selection | Shift + F7 | Shift + F7 |

The CS6 Help leaves the Windows cell blank for `Undo/Redo`; on Windows `Ctrl+Z`
remains the binding, and on Mac OS `F1` duplicates it because `Help` uses the
dedicated `Help` key. (Verified against the CS6 Help function-key table.)

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` | Dialog | `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt/Option+Shift+K` ✓ | Main editor; opens on Application Menus. |
| `Window > Workspace > Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus` | Dialog | — | Same dialog; Keyboard Shortcuts + Menus tabs. |
| `Edit > Preferences > General > Use Shift Key For Tool Switch` | Preference | `Ctrl/Cmd+K` | Changes tool-cycle behavior. |
| `Use Legacy Channel Shortcuts` | Dialog checkbox | — | In the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog. |
| `Summarize` | Dialog button | — | Exports HTML shortcut report. |
| Toolbox tool rows | Tools | letters above | Temporarily activates on hold. |
| Menu items | Application Menus | per default set | Shown in menus and tool tips. |
| Panel fly-outs | Panel Menus | per default set | Editor category. |
| `Animation (Timeline) panel menu > Enable Timeline Shortcut Keys` | Panel pref | — | Gates the Timeline keymap. |
| Context menus | Context menu | right-click / Control-click | Alternate access when a shortcut is unknown. |
| `Type > Font Preview Size` | Menu | — | Moved from Preferences in CS6. |

## Parameters & ranges

A shortcut binding is a structured key chord, not a scalar. Model parameters:

| Control | Type | Default | Range / options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Modifiers | set | — | Ctrl/Cmd, Alt/Option, Shift | Platform-aware labels. |
| Key | keycode | — | printable keys, F1–F24, arrows, nav, numpad | Some keys reserved by the OS. |
| Context | enum | Application Menus | Application Menus / Panel Menus / Tools | Determines conflict domain. |
| Set name | string | Photoshop Defaults | user-defined | Saved independently per workspace where set. |
| Tool-cycle mode | enum | Shift-gated | Shift-gated / letter-cycles | From General preference. |
| Legacy channel keys | bool | off | on/off | Alt/Option+1 vs Ctrl/Cmd+1. |

## Algorithms & pipeline

- **Resolution order (inferred from CS6 behavior):** active modal/dialog → focused text/type
  editing (dynamic shortcuts) → active tool (transient tool keys) → panel context → application
  menu command. The topmost handler that recognizes the chord consumes it. Adobe does not publish
  this table; treat as a design proposal to reproduce observed behavior.
- **Conflict handling:** assigning an existing chord steals it; `Accept and Go To Conflict`
  navigates to the previous owner. `Use Default` restores per-row defaults; `Undo Changes`
  reverts unsaved edits.
- **Persistence:** shortcut sets are stored in the same version settings folder as preferences
  and are separate from the document; CS6 warns that the reset gesture clears custom shortcuts.
- **Export:** `Summarize` serializes the whole resolved set (Application Menus + Panel Menus +
  Tools) to HTML.
- **Temporary tools:** pressing and holding a tool letter switches to that tool and returns to
  the prior tool on release; this is handled at the input layer, before command dispatch.
- **Modifier probing:** painting/selection tools poll Alt/Option, Shift, Space, Ctrl/Cmd during a
  drag to change mode (add/subtract/intersect, constrain, pan). These are not rebindable.

## Rust module mapping

- `crate::input::keymap::{KeyChord, Modifiers, KeyCode, Context}` — a chord is data
  (`mods + key`), not a string, so it can be compared and serialized deterministically.
- `crate::input::keymap::ShortcutSet` — named set with three maps (application, panel, tools)
  and a `defaults()` constructor seeded from the CS6 tables in this spec.
- `crate::input::keymap::ShortcutResolver` — layered dispatch: modal → dynamic text → transient
  tool → panel → menu. Returns a `CommandId`; unknown chords fall through.
- `crate::input::keymap::ConflictReport` — computed when assigning; powers Accept / Go To
  Conflict.
- `crate::input::keymap::summarize_html(&ShortcutSet) -> String` — parity with CS6 Summarize.
- `crate::input::dispatch::CommandId` — stable enum/id for every menu command, tool, and panel
  action; the shortcut map binds chords to these.
- `crate::prefs` integration: `UseShiftKeyForToolSwitch`, `LegacyChannelShortcuts` come from
  `Preferences` (`UI-010`).
- `crate::input::platform` — maps `Ctrl`/`Cmd`, `Alt`/`Option` labels and reserves OS/desktop
  chords (e.g. AT-SPI/Orca, GNOME shell) so they do not collide (`UI-012`).

Types crossing the boundary: `KeyChord`, `Context`, `CommandId`, `ShortcutSetSnapshot`.

## Qt6 component mapping

- `KeyboardShortcutsDialog` (QDialog) — `Set` combo, `Shortcuts For` combo, `QTreeView` of
  commands with an editable shortcut column (a `QKeySequenceEdit`-style delegate), and
  Save/Save Set As/Undo/Use Default/Cancel/Delete/Summarize buttons.
- `ShortcutTreeModel` (`QAbstractItemModel`) — one row per command; conflict highlighting role.
- `ShortcutEditDelegate` (`QStyledItemDelegate`) — captures a `QKeySequence`, validates conflicts.
- Qt provides `QKeySequence` + `QShortcut`/`QAction` natively; the design uses those rather than a
  custom chord type at the Qt layer, with `cxx-qt` marshalling to `KeyChord` in Rust. Note Qt's
  `QKeySequence` canonicalizes modifiers (Ctrl/Meta/Alt/Shift) and must map Linux `Meta` (Super)
  carefully.
- Menus use `QAction::setShortcut` so the same set drives both display and dispatch.
- QML is *not* used for the editor: native menus, key handling and screen-reader exposure are
  required (`UI-012`).

## Data-model impact

- **Not document data.** Shortcuts/workspaces are application-settings data; they do not enter
  PSD/XMP or the document undo stack.
- **Separate store** from the general preference values; has its own schema version and named
  sets. Each set can be exported/imported (CS6 Summarize HTML is a display/print artifact, not
  necessarily a re-import format).
- **Undo granularity:** dialog-level (Cancel rolls back all unsaved edits); there is no per-edit
  document undo.
- **Command IDs are the stable key**; labels/localization must not key the map, so translated
  menus still resolve.

## Edge cases

- **OS/desktop chord collisions** on Linux (`Super`, workspace switching, Orca screen-reader
  keys): reserve them and surface a conflict rather than silently stealing.
- **Keyboard layout:** non-US layouts and dead keys; bind to key codes + modifiers where
  possible, and document that some printable-key bindings are layout-dependent.
- **Numpad/NumLock** and **F-key** reservations in some window managers.
- **Modal dialogs:** application shortcuts must be suppressed or remapped while a modal owns
  input; only dialog-local shortcuts fire.
- **Type-edit mode:** single-letter tool keys must not fire while text is being entered; dynamic
  shortcuts take precedence.
- **Missing default shortcut** for a command: the command must still be reachable via menus (no
  dead command).
- **Custom shortcut removed:** `Use Default` restores it; otherwise the command is menu-only.
- **Extended-only bindings** (3D, measurement, DICOM, Timeline) must be hidden/absent in
  Standard-edition parity.
- **Localization:** shortcut labels (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`, `Alt`/`Option`) are platform-specific; the
  underlying chord is platform-normalized.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given the default set, every shortcut in the tables above resolves to the documented command
   (spot-check via the Help "Summarize" export compared row-by-row, allowing for the unresolved
   items listed under Open questions).
2. Given `Use Shift Key For Tool Switch` on, `Shift+L` cycles Lasso→Polygonal→Magnetic and `L`
   selects the Lasso; with it off, `L` alone cycles.
3. Given a chord already bound, assigning it to another command offers Accept / Undo / Accept and
   Go To Conflict, and `Use Default` restores the original binding.
4. Given `Summarize`, an HTML file is produced containing all three contexts and the resolved
   chords.
5. Given a saved custom set, relaunching preserves it; the CS6 preferences-reset gesture clears
   custom sets (parity with the CS6 Help warning).
6. Given edit mode in the Type tool, pressing `V` inserts "v" and does not switch to the Move
   tool, while the documented dynamic shortcuts still apply.
7. Given a modal dialog open, application-level shortcuts are suppressed and dialog shortcuts
   work.
8. Given Kooka Pictura on Linux, no default binding collides with a reserved desktop/AT infrastructure
   key without a conflict warning.

## Open questions

- **Exact default shortcuts not extractable cleanly** from the PDF layout (a handful of wrapped
  table rows). *Resolve:* compare against CS6's own `Summarize` HTML from a running install.
- **Dispatch precedence** (modal vs. text vs. tool vs. panel vs. menu) is inferred, not
  documented. *Resolve:* instrument a CS6 install or find an Adobe engineering reference.
- **Set/workspace relationship:** how a shortcut set is bound to a workspace, and whether sets
  are per-workspace or global. *Resolve:* CS6 Help "Workspace basics".
- **Import/export format:** whether `Summarize` HTML is the only export or an importable format
  exists. *Resolve:* CS6 Help / testing.
- **Dynamic shortcut full list:** the Character panel menu lists them only contextually. *Resolve:*
  type-tool testing on CS6.
- **Linux key reservations:** which default CS6 bindings collide with GNOME/KDE/Orca. *Resolve:*
  test matrix on target desktops.
- **Unresolved table cells** (none remain in the transcribed tables; any future capture
  discrepancies) must be confirmed before status `Spec'd`.
