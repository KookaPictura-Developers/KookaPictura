# Menus

- **Spec ID:** `UI-002`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — a new **Type** menu was added and most text/type functionality moved there; the CS6 default keyboard-shortcut table and Help add `Type > Warp Text`, `Type > Paste Lorem Ipsum`, `Type > Font Preview Size`, `Type > Language Options`, `Type > Load/Save Default Type Styles`; the **3D** menu was reworked for the new 3D engine (Extended only); Windows gained New/Open by context-clicking document tabs; menu items can be hidden/coloured and shown temporarily.
- **Depends on:** `UI-001` application-frame, `UI-003` workspace-and-docks, `UI-004` toolbox-and-options-bar, `11-cross-cutting/localization.md`

> **This is a reference spec.** Every item confirmed directly by the fetched CS6
> Help reference (via its `Choose X > Y > …` instructions and shortcut tables),
> or by a CS6 Help-derived secondary reference, is marked **✓**. Items that
> remain unresolved are marked **`(unverified)`**. Shortcuts are Windows; Mac
> substitutes `Cmd` for `Ctrl` and `Option` for `Alt` unless noted. This document
> is intentionally exhaustive; the `(unverified)` set is the residual
> screenshot-diff backlog against CS6 (a handful of items, see Open questions).

## CS6 behavior

- Photoshop has **eleven top-level menus** (Standard and Extended alike):
  **File, Edit, Image, Layer, Type, Select, Filter, 3D\*, View, Window, Help**
  (\*the **3D** menu appears only in Photoshop Extended). This matches the CS6
  Help reference and CS6 tutorial sources. CS5 Extended's separate **Analysis**
  menu has no CS6 residual: its functionality is now the Count/Ruler tools and
  the `Window > Measurement Log` panel (CS6 Help, "Counting objects in an image"
  and "Measurement (Photoshop Extended)").
- **Menus are customizable.** `Edit > Menus…` (or
  `Window > Workspace > Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus > Menus` tab) opens the
  Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus dialog, which can **show/hide** or **colour**
  items for both **Application Menus** and **Panel Menus**. Hidden items can be
  revealed temporarily with `Show All Menu Items` or `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-clicking the
  menu, and permanently with `Window > Workspace > Essentials`. Menu colours are
  toggled with `Show Menu Colors` in Interface preferences. The `New in CS6`
  workspace highlights new menu items in blue.
- **Menus grey out** when a command is inapplicable to the current document,
  tool, selection, layer kind or mode (e.g. Save unavailable on an untitled
  read-only document; many filters unavailable in Bitmap/Indexed/Duotone or in
  32-bit; 3D commands absent in Standard). The Help documents specific cases:
  `Edit > Clear` acts as Cut when pixels are selected; `View > Zoom In/Out`
  disable at the zoom limits; `Edit > Undo` toggles to `Redo`; palette commands
  that cannot apply are disabled by the same rule as Illustrator/InDesign.
  A precise per-item enablement matrix is not yet sourced — this is the bulk of
  the remaining work for this spec.
- **Context menus** are distinct from the menu bar and show commands relevant to
  the active tool, selection, or panel (e.g. right-click the canvas with the
  Eyedropper for sample-size options; right-click a layer for layer commands;
  right-click the tool icon in the options bar for `Reset Tool`/`Reset All
  Tools`; right-click the canvas background for canvas colour / Snap settings;
  right-click a document tab for New/Open on CS6 Windows).
- **Platform split.** On Windows the menu bar sits in the application frame; on
  Mac the application menu (`Photoshop > …`) carries About/Preferences/Services/
  Hide/Quit and the product menus follow. See `UI-001`.

## Algorithms & pipeline

Design proposal; the menu system is declarative and generated by Qt.

- **Single menu source of truth.** Menus are declared once in a data table
  (id, path, shortcut, enablement predicate, checked state, platform mapping).
  The Windows menu bar, the Mac application menu, the panel context menus and
  the Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus dialog all read the same registry. This is what
  makes customisation and temporary "show all" possible.
- **Enablement.** Each command carries a predicate over
  `(document, activeTool, selection, layerKind, colourMode, bitDepth, edition)`.
  A disabled command is greyed, not hidden; a hidden command is absent unless
  `Show All Menu Items` / `Ctrl`-click is used.
- **Custom menu sets.** A set stores per-item `{visible, colour}` keyed by a
  stable command id. Applying a set rebuilds the menus. `Reset` restores the
  Photoshop Defaults set.
- **Dynamic labels.** A few items change label/state: `Undo`↔`Redo`,
  `Window > 3D` toggle, `View > Show > …` check marks, `Window > Arrange >
  [Workspace Name]` reset label, `View > Proof Setup` active profile check.
- **Command dispatch.** Menu activation emits a `Command` intent to the command
  layer (`ARCH-005`); undoable commands create history records, view/toggle
  commands do not.
- **Localisation.** Command ids are stable; labels come from a translation
  catalogue (`11-cross-cutting/localization.md`). The `(unverified)` items must
  still be mapped to ids so translations and shortcuts survive.

## Rust module mapping

Proposals.

- `pictura_ui::menu::Registry` — command table: `CommandId`, `MenuPath`,
  `Shortcut`, `EnablePredicate`, `CheckedProvider`, `PlatformMap`.
- `pictura_ui::menu::CustomSet` — `{ CommandId -> {visible, colour} }`,
  serialization, apply/reset.
- `pictura_ui::menu::context` — context-menu builders keyed by
  `(surface, activeTool, selectionKind, itemKind)`.
- `pictura_ui::shortcuts` — shortcut sets, conflict detection, `Use Legacy
  Channel Shortcuts`, `Use Shift Key For Tool Switch`.
- `pictura_ui::menu::enable` — the predicate functions over document state.

Crossing types: `CommandId` (string/interned id), `MenuPath`, `Shortcut`
(sequence of key+modifiers), `CustomSet`. No document data crosses; enable
predicates query the document through the bridge and return `bool`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `PicturaMenuBar` | `QMenuBar` | Windows-style top-level menus; hidden in Full Screen modes |
| `CommandRegistry` | `QObject` | Command table; creates `QAction`s with data-carrying ids |
| `MenuBuilder` | `QObject` | Rebuilds `QMenu`s from registry + custom set; wires enablement |
| `ShortcutManager` | `QObject` | `QShortcut`/`QAction` shortcut sets, conflict checks, platform mapping |
| `ContextMenuFactory` | `QObject` | Builds per-surface `QMenu` on `contextMenuEvent` |
| `KeyboardMenusDialog` | `QDialog` | `Edit > Menus` + `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` (tabs) |

`QAction` is the natural unit: it carries text, shortcut, enabled/checked state,
and emits `triggered` carrying the command id. Use a command id in
`QAction::setData` rather than string-matching action text, so translations and
custom sets stay stable. `QMenu::aboutToShow` recomputes enablement
predicates so menus are correct on every open.

## Data-model impact

- **Command enablement reads, never writes, the document.** It is recomputed on
  `aboutToShow` from current document/tool/selection state.
- **Menu custom sets and shortcut sets are preference state** (not document
  data): stored per user, optionally captured into a workspace
  (`UI-003`). They never enter PSD/XMP.
- **Command history:** undoable commands record history via `ARCH-007`; toggles
  and view commands are explicitly non-undoable. The menu is not a history
  record.
- **Stable ids matter for the future**: every menu item needs a
  fixed id before localisation and shortcut remapping can be frozen.

## Edge cases

- **No document open.** Document-requiring commands disabled; File/Edit core and
  Help remain.
- **Colour mode / bit depth.** Bitmap, Indexed, Duotone and 32-bit disallow
  large parts of Image/Layer/Filter; enablement must reflect this rather than
  failing at execution. (Help documents many such restrictions.)
- **Standard vs Extended.** The 3D menu and all 3D/video/measurement commands
  are absent in Standard, not merely disabled.
- **Smart Objects.** Filter commands become smart-filter commands; `Fade` and
  destructive-only items disable on a smart object.
- **No selection.** Selection-dependent Edit/Layer/Select items disable.
- **Custom set hides a needed item.** `Show All Menu Items` / `Ctrl`-click must
  still reach it; a "reset to defaults" path must exist.
- **Shortcut collisions.** Remapping can collide; the dialog must warn and the
  dispatcher must resolve deterministically.
- **Mac application menu.** About/Preferences/Services/Hide/Quit have no direct
  Linux equivalent; map to a menu bar `Help > About` and `Edit > Preferences`,
  and document the divergence.
- **Transient state.** Menu labels that change (`Undo`/`Redo`, active proof
  profile) must update without rebuilding the whole menu.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given a fresh install, all eleven top-level menus (ten in Standard) and their
  documented submenus exist, in the documented order.
- Given a Bitmap-mode document, image/layer/filter commands CS6 disables are
  greyed in the same states; given a Standard licence, the 3D menu is absent.
- Given `Edit > Menus` and a hidden item, the item disappears from the menu,
  `Ctrl`-click / `Show All Menu Items` reveals it transiently, and
  `Window > Workspace > Essentials` reveals it permanently.
- Given an item coloured in the Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus dialog with
  `Show Menu Colors` on, it renders in that colour; turning the preference off
  suppresses the colour.
- Given a saved custom menu/shortcut set captured into a workspace, switching to
  that workspace applies the set and switching away restores the defaults.
- Given `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` and a remapped command, the new shortcut
  fires the command and the old one does not.
- Given no open document, every document-requiring menu item is disabled and the
  application does not crash.
- Given a right-click on the canvas, the tool/selection-appropriate context
  menu appears; right-clicking the options-bar tool icon offers
  `Reset Tool`/`Reset All Tools`.
- Given `Window > Arrange > New Window For [file]`, a second window for the same
  document opens and both stay in sync.
- Given the CS6 `New in CS6` workspace with menu colours enabled, new items
  render in the highlight colour.
- Given a translated build, every visible menu label comes from the catalogue
  and command ids are unchanged.

  official Photoshop CS6 Help reference (downloaded and text-extracted). This is
  the primary source for the **✓** items: it contains hundreds of
  `Choose X > Y > …` instructions across File, Edit, Image, Layer, Type, Select,
  Filter, 3D, View, Window and Help, plus the default shortcut tables (tool
  keys, `Keys for using panels`, function keys) and the panel/menu customisation
  chapter (`Edit > Menus`, Hide/show, colour, temporary reveal, `Show All Menu
  Items`), the CS6 Type-menu announcement, the 3D menu commands, and the
  screen-mode commands.

## Open questions

- **Per-item enablement matrix.** The Help documents many greying rules
  piecemeal; a complete `command × document-state` enablement table is not
  sourced. Resolve with a CS6 screenshot/interaction pass for every command.
- **Exact leaf membership and ordering of Filter submenus.** The Help's `Choose`
  paths prove every CS6 filter name and the canonical Brush Strokes / Sketch /
  Texture / Video groupings, but not the on-screen ordering. Resolve with a CS6
  `Filter` menu capture per submenu.
- **`3D` menu ordering and residual items** (`Merge 3D Layers`,
  `Get More Content…`, whether `New Mesh from Layer` survived the rename to
  `New Mesh From Grayscale`, and the full `New Shape From Layer` preset list).
  Resolve with an Extended CS6 capture.
- **`Filter > Browse Filters Online…`** — existence in CS6 is unverified.
  Resolve with a CS6 `Filter` menu capture.
- **`Type > OpenType`** — whether CS6 exposes OpenType options as a Type submenu
  or only in the Character panel menu. Resolve with a CS6 capture.
- **Help menu tail** (`Adobe Product Improvement Program`, `System Info`) —
  listed by tertiary sources, not the fetched CS6 Help. Resolve with a CS6
  `Help` menu capture.
- **Mac application-menu contents.** The CS6 keyboard-shortcut sheet shows the
  `Photoshop` menu carrying `Preferences…`, `Hide Photoshop` (`Cmd+H`),
  `Hide Others` (`Opt+Cmd+H`), and `Quit Photoshop` (`Cmd+Q`); `Services` and
  `About Photoshop` placement is still uncaptured.
- **Default shortcuts for many non-tool commands.** Only the documented tables
  are sourced; the rest need a CS6 keybinding capture. Feeds
