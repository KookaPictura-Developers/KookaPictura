# Preferences

- **Spec ID:** `UI-010`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 restyles the Preferences dialog (dark theme, same left-hand
  pane list), adds the **Auto Save / Automatically Save Recovery Information** and **Save in
  Background** options to File Handling, moves **History Log** under General, expands **GPU
  Settings** (Mercury Graphics Engine) under Performance, adds **Enable Flick Panning**,
  **Animated Zoom**, **Place Or Drag Raster Images As Smart Objects**, and the **3D**
  preference pane (Extended). The Interface pane gains the four **Color Theme** swatches,
  **UI Font Size** options, **Enable Text Drop Shadows**, and a **canvas colour per screen
  mode**. CS5 already had the same pane list: General, Interface, File Handling, Performance,
  Cursors, Transparency & Gamut, Units & Rulers, Guides/Grid & Slices, Plug-ins and Type.
- **Depends on:** `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md`, `01-architecture/document-model.md`,
  `01-architecture/performance-targets.md`, `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`,
  `02-ui-ux/keyboard-shortcuts.md` (`UI-011`), `02-ui-ux/accessibility.md` (`UI-012`),
  `04-image-ops/image-size.md`, `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`, `02-ui-ux/panels/timeline-panel.md`.

> Module, crate and type names are **design proposals**. Panel/setting behavior is taken from

## CS6 behavior

Photoshop CS6 stores "numerous program settings … including general display options,
file-saving options, performance options, cursor options, transparency options, type options,
and options for plug-ins and scratch disks. Most of these options are set in the Preferences
dialog box. Preference settings are saved each time you quit the application."
(`photoshop_reference.pdf`, "Preferences").

Preferences are opened from `Edit > Preferences` (Windows) / `Photoshop > Preferences` (Mac OS)
and then a pane is chosen from the submenu. The dialog itself lists the same panes down the left
side; the user can switch panes with the left-hand list, or with **Next** / **Prev**. The
**General** pane is the default. In CS6 the dialog follows the dark application theme.

### Opening and resetting preferences

- **Open a pane:** the menu path above, or `Ctrl/Cmd+K` for General. The CS6 Help documents
  only `Ctrl/Cmd+K`; the `Ctrl/Cmd+2`…`Ctrl/Cmd+9` pane shortcuts sometimes reported are not
  in the CS6 Help and collide with documented channel/zoom shortcuts (`Ctrl+1` = Magnify 100%,
  `Ctrl+2`…`5` = composite/RGB channels), so treat them as unverified (see
  `## Open questions`).
- **Switch pane:** click a pane in the left column, or click **Next** / **Prev**.
- **Reset all warning dialogs:** General pane → **Reset All Warning Dialogs** → OK.
- **Restore to default:**
  - Move/delete the preferences file; Photoshop recreates defaults on next launch.
  - Or hold `Alt+Ctrl+Shift` (Windows) / `Option+Command+Shift` (Mac OS) **while starting**
    Photoshop and confirm. CS6 Help notes this also resets custom shortcuts, workspaces and
    color settings.

### Persistence

CS6 keeps settings in the "Adobe Photoshop CS6 Prefs" file (`.psp`) inside the version-specific
Settings folder. Per the CS6 Help link "Preference filenames and locations in CS6" and Adobe
Community answers (CS6 13.0 x64):

| Platform | Path (community-verified for CS6) |
|---|---|
| Windows (Vista/7/8/10) | `%APPDATA%\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6\Adobe Photoshop CS6 Settings\Adobe Photoshop CS6 Prefs.psp` |
| Windows (XP) | `Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6\...` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Preferences/Adobe Photoshop CS6 Settings/Adobe Photoshop CS6 Prefs.psp` |

Some preset libraries (brushes, swatches, styles, patterns, contours) written from panels are
also stored in a preferences file, not the document.

CS6 also exposes `Edit > Purge > All / Undo / Histories / Camera Raw` and `Edit > Clear` in the
History panel menu; these are separate commands, not preference fields, but they appear next to
the Performance topic in Help.

### Pane: Cursors

| Setting | Type | CS6 default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Painting Cursors: Standard | radio | selected | Tool-icon pointer. |
| Painting Cursors: Precise | radio | — | Cross-hair pointer. |

| Extension panels: Allow Extensions To Connect To The Internet | checkbox | off *(secondary)* | CS6 Extension panel internet access. |
| Enable Remote Connections | checkbox | off *(secondary)* | Debug/remote connection port. |

A plug-in installed elsewhere can be linked by placing a shortcut (Windows) or alias (Mac OS)
in the Plug-ins folder. If the plug-in list grows too long, newly installed plug-ins fall back
to `Filter > Other`.

### Pane: Type

| Setting | Type | CS6 default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Show Font Names In English | checkbox | off | Displays Asian font names in English. |
| East Asian / Show Asian Text Options | checkbox | off | CS6 labels the East Asian engine choice; enables CJK options in the Character/Paragraph panels. |

## Algorithms & pipeline

Preferences are an application-level key/value store, not a document transform. The pipeline is:
**startup** → load store (or seed defaults if absent/corrupt) → **mutate** via pane widgets →
**persist** on quit (or immediately for a few live options) → **consume** by feature modules.

- **Store format:** Adobe uses a proprietary `.psp` binary. Behavior parity does not require
  bit-compatibility; it requires the *observable* persistence contract: "settings are saved
  each time you quit"; wrong/corrupt preferences reproduce as defaults; deleting the store
  resets everything.
- **Startup reset gesture** intercepts launch before the store is read and moves/ignores the
  existing file.
- **Live vs. deferred:** most changes apply immediately; Memory Usage, History/Cache, UI Font
  Size and some GPU options require a restart (CS6 says so for several). The exact restart set
  is an open question.
- **Scratch-disk ordering** is an ordered list of mounted volumes; Photoshop writes its scratch
  file to the first with capacity, spilling to later entries.
- **History States** bounds the undo ring in memory/scratch; **Cache Levels** pick the image
  pyramid (see `04-image-ops/image-size.md`, `01-architecture/performance-targets.md`).
- Behavioral parity only; Adobe's exact default values for many fields are not published in the
  CS6 PDF. Do not guess them.

## Rust module mapping

- `crate::prefs::Preferences` — typed mirror of every pane; serializable. One struct per pane
  (`GeneralPrefs`, `InterfacePrefs`, `FileHandlingPrefs`, `PerformancePrefs`, `CursorPrefs`,
  `TransparencyPrefs`, `UnitsPrefs`, `GuidesGridSlicesPrefs`, `PluginsPrefs`, `TypePrefs`,
  `ThreeDPrefs`), each `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`.
- `crate::prefs::PrefsStore` — load/save to a platform path; atomic replace; corruption → defaults.
- `crate::prefs::PrefsSchema` — field metadata (key, type, default, range, pane, restart
  requirement). Drives both the Qt dialog and validation, so defaults live in one place.
- `crate::prefs::PreferencesService` — `watch`-style subscription: `get::<T>()`, `set(...)`,
  emits `PrefsChanged { key, old, new }` over a channel for consumers (zoom, cursors, GPU).
- `crate::prefs::paths::prefs_path()` — XDG-correct location on Linux:
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kooka-pictura/prefs.json` (or `~/.config/...`), encoding the CS6 layout as
  a *migration source*, not the on-disk format.
- `crate::prefs::import::cs6` — optional, independent best-effort importer that can read a user's
  CS6 `.psp` only if publicly documented later; off by default (see `00-overview/licensing-and-provenance.md`).
- Scratch disks/GPU: `crate::render::{GpuSettings, ScratchDiskConfig}` consumed by
  `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`.

Types crossing the Rust↔Qt boundary: `GeneralPrefs`, `InterfacePrefs`, …, `PrefsChanged`,
`PrefsFieldMeta`. All are plain data; no Qt types leak into Rust.

## Qt6 component mapping

- `PreferencesDialog` (QDialog) — left `QListView` of panes + `QStackedWidget` of pane
  `QWidget`s; OK/Cancel/Next/Prev buttons. Widgets (not QML) for desktop-native dialog
  behaviour, native menus, and screen-reader exposure.
- `PreferencesPage` (abstract QWidget) — each pane subclasses it; builds controls from
  `PrefsSchema` metadata.
- `ColorSwatchGrid`, `UnitComboBox`, `ScratchDiskListWidget`, `HistoryStatesSpin`, `MemoryUsageSlider`
  — small reusable widgets.
- `PreferencesModel` (QAbstractItemModel) — pane list with icons/labels.
- `PrefsController` (`QObject`, `cxx-qt`/`qmetaobject-rs`) — marshals `PreferencesService` to
  Q_PROPERTYs and slots; emits `changed(key)`.
- Theme: CS6's four-step gray theme is a `QPalette` + `qss` variant; UI Font Size maps to a
  global `QApplication` font. High-DPI/theme integration is specified in `UI-012`.

## Data-model impact

- **Not document data.** Preferences never serialize into PSD/XMP and never enter the document
  undo stack. CS6 Help is explicit: "Program-wide changes, such as changes to panels, color
  settings, actions, and preferences, are not reflected in the History panel."
- **Application-level store** with its own schema version and migration. A `prefs_version`
  field allows forward migration; unknown keys are preserved on write where possible.
- **Per-workspace shortcuts** are a separate store (see `UI-011`); per-document guides/grid
  overrides (document grid settings, slices) belong to the document model, not here.
- **Undo:** preference edits are not undoable via the document History. A Preferences dialog
  Cancel must roll back uncommitted widget state.

## Edge cases

- **Missing/corrupt store:** recreate defaults; do not crash. The CS6 "damaged preferences"
  troubleshooting flow is the contract.
- **No writable config dir:** run with in-memory defaults and surface a warning; do not lose the
  current session.
- **GPU absent/unsupported:** `Enable OpenGL Drawing` is unavailable/greyed; all GPU-gated
  options (Animated Zoom, HUD picker, 3D, Oil Paint) fall back or disable. See
  `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`.
- **Scratch disk full/removed:** reorder to next available; surface the CS6-style scratch error.
- **64-bit vs. 32-bit:** 32-bit builds cap Memory Usage (≈1.7–3.2 GB). Linux target is 64-bit
  only; keep a documented cap for parity tests.
- **Extended vs. Standard:** the 3D pane is absent in Standard; hide it rather than showing a
  dead pane.
- **Multiple monitors / mixed DPI:** UI Font Size and color theme are app-global; per-monitor
  scaling is a Qt/host concern (`UI-012`).
- **Reset gesture while another instance runs / file locked:** refuse to reset and warn.
- **Localization:** `Show Font Names In English`, Asian/Middle-Eastern engines, smart-quote
  default depend on locale; defaults are locale-sensitive.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a fresh profile, opening `Edit > Preferences > General` shows a dark-theme dialog whose
   left pane list is exactly: General, Interface, File Handling, Performance, Cursors,
   Transparency & Gamut, Units & Rulers, Guides/Grid/Slices, Plug-ins, Type (and 3D in Extended).
2. Given a changed setting, quitting and relaunching restores the changed value; deleting the
   store and relaunching restores CS6 defaults.
3. Given `Alt+Ctrl+Shift` (Win) / `Cmd+Option+Shift` (Mac) held at launch and confirmed, all
   panes report defaults afterward and custom shortcut/workspace/color sets are reset.
4. Given the Memory Usage / History States / Cache Levels fields, values outside the documented
   range are rejected; a restart-required change shows the CS6 restart prompt.
5. Given a GPU that fails the OpenGL probe, `Enable OpenGL Drawing` is disabled and exactly the
   GPU-dependent features are unavailable — no crash on toggling.
6. Given a document with a gamut-warning color set, `View > Gamut Warning` overlays
   out-of-gamut pixels using that color at that opacity.
7. Given `Automatically Save Recovery Information` on and a simulated crash, relaunch offers
   recovery of the last interval's work.
8. Given a locked/read-only config location, the app starts with defaults and warns; no settings
   are silently discarded without notice.

## Open questions

- **Remaining CS6 defaults not yet pinned:** Image Previews, Maximize PSD/PSB compatibility,
  transparency grid size/colour, and the guide/grid/slice colours. *Resolve:* read a known-fresh
  CS6 profile or a VM install.
- **Cache Levels default is contested:** CS6-era sources say **6**, Adobe's current KB says **4**.
  *Resolve:* inspect a fresh CS6 Performance pane (a screenshot or VM).
- **Per-pane keyboard shortcuts** (`Ctrl+2`…`Ctrl+9`) are **not documented** in the CS6 Help, and
  `Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+5` are already Magnify 100 % / channel shortcuts. Treat any "reported" pane
  shortcut as unverified (likely non-existent). *Resolve:* a CS6 session or the exported CS6
  shortcut list.
- **Which settings require a restart in CS6.** The Help and secondary sources name Memory Usage,
  History States and UI Font Size; a definitive list is not published. *Resolve:* systematic
  toggle-and-observe on CS6.
- **GPU Advanced Settings** (Drawing Mode Basic/Normal/Advanced, vertical sync) exact options and
  defaults. *Resolve:* the CS6 GPU FAQ page (Adobe) or a machine with a supported GPU.
- **Cache Levels / History States numeric ranges** are secondary-sourced (1–8 and 1–1000).
  *Resolve:* inspect the CS6 spinbox ranges.
- **History Log first-run default.** The Help implies per-session logging to metadata is on by
  default, but the checkbox default is commonly described as off. *Resolve:* a fresh CS6 profile.
- **File Handling CS6-only additions** — whether `Save in Background` and
  `Automatically Save Recovery Information` have additional sub-options. *Resolve:* the CS6 Help
  File Handling page or a capture.
- **Persistence format and interop:** should Kooka Pictura offer any CS6 `.psp` import? Legal and
  legal review needed (`00-overview/licensing-and-provenance.md`).
- **Linux preference location:** confirm XDG (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) vs. Qt `QSettings` native
  format; decide JSON vs. TOML for the spec's reference store.
