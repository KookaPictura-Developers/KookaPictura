# Measurement Log Panel

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-023`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Extended-only` — the CS6 source feature is Photoshop **Extended** only. Kooka Pictura treats measurement/count/DICOM parity as a `Non-goal (Linux)` (`OVR-003`); a `Core` build must still **represent and preserve** the data.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the Measurement Log and its workflow are carried from CS5; the CS6 Help documents the Measurement feature under "(Photoshop Extended)" with no functional change called out.
- **Depends on:** `03-tools/note-and-count.md` (`TOOL-019` Count tool; the Measurement Log is the shared record surface), `03-tools/eyedropper-color-sampler-ruler.md` (Ruler tool / measurement scale), `10-workflow-io/measurement-and-count.md` (record schema, export, persistent measurement data — currently *planned* in `INDEX.md`), `00-overview/cs6-editions-and-constraints.md` (`OVR-002`), `00-overview/feasibility-and-non-goals.md` (`OVR-003`), `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-008`), `01-architecture/undo-history.md` (`ARCH-009`).

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF unless marked *(inferred)*. Per `OVR-003`, exact measurement parity is a non-goal; this spec defines the UI surface and the preservation contract.

## CS6 behavior

The **Measurement Log panel** (`Window > Measurement Log`) is the record surface for the Extended-only measurement and counting workflow. Measurements are made with the **Ruler tool**, the **Count tool**, or **selection tools**, and recorded into the log by `Analysis > Record Measurements` (also a **Record Measurements** button in the panel). Each row is a **measurement set**; each column is a **data point**.

**

### Measurement scale

- `Analysis > Set Measurement Scale` sets a document's scale (pixels ↔ logical units such as inches, millimetres, or microns). Multiple **presets** are allowed, but **only one scale is active per document**.
- `Analysis > Set Measurement Scale > Default` returns to **1 pixel = 1 pixel**.
- `Custom` opens the **Measurement Scale** dialog: the Ruler tool is auto-selected; drag (or type **Pixel Length**) and enter **Logical Length** and **Logical Units**.
- Scale is shown in the **Info panel** (panel menu → Panel Options → Measurement Scale) and optionally at the document-window bottom (`Show > Measurement Scale` from the document window menu), and is saved with the document via `File > Save`.
- **Create a preset:** `Set Measurement Scale > Custom` → set scale → **Save Preset** → name → OK. **Delete a preset:** `Custom` → select preset → **Delete Preset** → OK.
- **DICOM note:** measurement scale is imported automatically from DICOM files. *(DICOM is out of scope per `OVR-003`; preserve only.)*

### Scale markers

`Analysis > Place Scale Marker` places a scale marker in the lower-left corner and adds a **layer group** to the document containing a text layer (when **Display Text** is on) plus a graphic layer. The **Measurement Scale Marker** dialog exposes **Length**, **Font**, **Font Size**, **Display Text**, **Text position** (above/below), and **Color** (black/white). Adding another marker offers **Remove**/**Keep** for the existing one; markers are moved/edited with the Move/Type tools and deleted by deleting the marker's layer group.

### Data points and recording

- `Analysis > Select Data Points` chooses which data points are recorded; `Custom` opens the **Select Data Points** dialog (grouped by measuring tool; **Common** points available to all tools; all selected by default). A subset can be saved as a **data point preset**, edited, or deleted.
- If a measurement is made with a tool whose data points are not selected, the user is prompted to select them ().
- Recording is via `Analysis > Record Measurements` or the panel's **Record Measurements** button. A **Count** measurement requires the Count data point to be enabled (`03-tools/note-and-count.md`, `TOOL-019`).
- **Multiple selections:** one summary/cumulative row for all selected areas, followed by one row per selection area; each area is a **Feature** in the **Label** column with a unique number. The **Document** column identifies the source document, so a single log can span documents.
- Measurements use the scale units in effect *at the moment of recording*.

### Measurement Log operations

- **Rows:** click to select; `Shift`-click for contiguous; `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-click for non-contiguous; **Select All** / **Select None**. Rows cannot be manually reordered.
- **Columns:** click a header to select; `Shift`/`Ctrl`-click for contiguous/non-contiguous; drag to reorder; drag the separator to resize; click a header to sort, or right-click → **Sort Ascending**/**Sort Descending**.
- **Delete:** select rows/columns → `Delete` from the options menu, the panel's Delete icon, or right-click → Delete.
- **Export:** select rows → `Export` from the options menu, the Export icon, or right-click → Export → filename/location → Save. Output is a **comma-delimited UTF-8 text file**. *(The CS6 text says both "tab-delimited, Unicode text file" in the About section and "comma-delimited text file" for export; see Open questions.)*
- **Histogram** data is exported to a separate **CSV** file in its own folder beside the log export, numbered from 0; one file for the total selected area plus one per selection.

### Measurement data points (CS6 list)

**Angle** (Ruler orientation ±0–180), **Area** (square pixels or calibrated units), **Circularity** (`4π·area/perimeter²`; 1.0 = circle), **Count** (discontiguous selection areas; counted items; or Ruler lines 1/2), **Date and Time**, **Document**, **Gray Value** (0–255/8-bit, 0–32,768/16-bit, 0.0–10/32-bit; image internally converted to grayscale via the default grayscale profile, then mean/median/min/max per feature and summary), **Height** (`max y − min y`), **Histogram** (per-channel counts, 8-bit), **Integrated Density** (`Area × Mean Gray Value`), **Label** (automatic Measurement N + Feature labels), **Length** (Ruler distance), **Perimeter**, **Scale** (source scale), **Scale Units**, **Scale Factor** (pixels per scale unit), **Source** (Ruler tool / Count tool / Selection), **Width** (`max x − min x`).

## Algorithms & pipeline

The measurement engine is **largely documented at the semantics level only**; the exact numeric implementation is Adobe-closed in places, and `OVR-003` classifies exact parity as a non-goal.

1. **Scale resolution.** `logical_per_pixel = logical_length / pixel_length`. All calibrated data points (Area/Height/Width/Length/Perimeter/Scale Factor) are computed with the document's active scale; uncalibrated (pixel) values remain available.
2. **Selection measurement.** Compute per-selection area, perimeter, bounding box (height/width), mean/median/min/max gray, integrated density, and circularity from the selection mask and the (optionally grayscale-converted) pixels. For multiple selections, emit one cumulative row then one row per connected selection, labelled as Features.
3. **Ruler measurement.** Length = Euclidean distance; angle = orientation ±0–180; Count of Ruler lines = 1 or 2.
4. **Count measurement.** A selection counts **discontiguous selected areas**; the Count tool counts placed count marks (including, in the automatic workflow, connected components of a Magic Wand / Color Range selection — see `TOOL-019`).
5. **Gray Value conversion.** The image is *internally converted to grayscale using the default grayscale profile* before brightness statistics; 16/32-bit values are scaled to the documented ranges. Histogram is per channel, reduced to 8-bit.
6. **Recording.** Appending a record copies the selected data points for the current measurement into a new row; existing rows are immutable to later on-image edits (clearing counts does not rewrite the log; `TOOL-019`).
7. **Export.** Serialize rows/columns to a delimited UTF-8 text file; each Histogram point writes its own CSV in a sibling folder with sequential names from 0.

**Non-goal note.** The precise selection/edge/AA treatment and the exact data-point formulas beyond those quoted are not fully documented; this spec claims **behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD** and, per `OVR-003`, a preserve-and-report contract.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_measure::MeasurementScale` — `{ pixel_length, logical_length, logical_units }`; presets.
- `pictura_measure::DataPoint` — enum of the 17 CS6 data points; `DataPointSet` (Common + per-tool), presets.
- `pictura_measure::MeasurementRecord` — `{ label, feature, document_id, source: Ruler|Count|Selection, values: Map<DataPoint, Value>, scale }`.
- `pictura_measure::MeasurementLog` — `Vec<MeasurementRecord>`; append-only; sort/select/delete/export. **Shared with `03-tools/note-and-count.md`** (`pictura_core::measure::MeasurementLog`).
- `pictura_measure::scale_marker` — marker parameters plus the layer group it creates (text + graphic).
- `pictura_measure::export` — delimited text + histogram CSV writer.
- `pictura_core::document` gains an opaque `measurement` field to preserve image resources **1074 (Measurement Scale)** and **1080 (Count Information)** on round-trip (`OVR-002`).

Crossing types: `MeasurementRecord`, `DataPoint`, `Value`, `MeasurementScale`, `DocumentId`. No Qt types cross into `pictura_measure`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `MeasurementLogPanel` | `QDockWidget` | Host; Record/Delete/Export buttons; options menu |
| `MeasurementLogModel` | `QAbstractTableModel` | Rows = records, columns = data points; sort/selection |
| `MeasurementLogView` | `QTableView` | Column select/reorder/resize/sort; row multi-select |
| `DataPointsDialog` | `QDialog` | Common/tool data points; preset save/edit/delete |
| `MeasurementScaleDialog` | `QDialog` | Pixel/Logical Length/Units; Save/Delete Preset |
| `ScaleMarkerDialog` | `QDialog` | Length/font/size/display/position/color; add or replace |
| `RecordMeasurementsAction` | `QAction` | Enabled with a supported measuring tool / valid selection |

Widgets over QML (dense table, model/view, keyboard-centric; `ARCH-003`). Sort/filter live in a proxy model; export runs off the GUI thread. The panel is **absent/disabled** in a Standard-parity build (`OVR-002`), while preserved measurement image resources remain readable.

## Data-model impact

- **Document data.** Measurement scale is a document setting saved with the file; the panel edits it. **Count Information** and **Measurement Scale** image resources (`1080`, `1074`) are Extended-relevant and round-trip even in a `Core` build (`OVR-002`, `OVR-003`).
- **Scale markers** materialize as real layers (a layer group with text + graphic), so they are ordinary document nodes and participate in undo and PSD serialization.
- **Measurement Log rows** are **append-only session/document records**; recording does not mutate on-image counts, and clearing on-image counts leaves existing rows (`TOOL-019`).
- **Undo.** Measurement scale changes, scale-marker placement, and data-point preset edits are commands (scale and markers document-level; presets app-state). Appending a log row is a non-undoable record by design (CS6 does not undo log rows) *(inferred)*.
- **Preservation contract.** A `Core` build must open a CS6 Extended PSD, keep the measurement resources and scale-marker layer group intact, and report the Measurement Log surface as unavailable.
- **No XMP impact** beyond whatever DICOM/file metadata a source file carried.

## Edge cases

- **Standard-parity build** — panel absent/disabled; preserved resources still round-trip (`OVR-002`).
- **No scale set** — default 1 px = 1 px is used and the log records Scale/Scale Units/Scale Factor accordingly.
- **Mixed scales across documents** — each record carries the scale in effect at record time; the `Document` column disambiguates.
- **Multiple selections** — cumulative row plus per-selection rows and Features; must not double-count the summary.
- **Empty selection** — Record Measurements is disabled or no-ops; never writes a garbage row.
- **Non-grayscale/CMYK/Lab/32-bit** — Gray Value uses the internal grayscale conversion; the panel must not silently read raw channels.
- **Histogram export** — many selections produce many CSVs; enforce a file-count/name scheme and report the folder.
- **Delimiter mismatch** — the About text says tab-delimited while the export procedure says comma-delimited; pick and document one (Open questions).
- **DICOM** — out of scope (`OVR-003`); open/import must preserve metadata without claiming analysis parity.
- **Huge PSB / many selections** — perimeter/area/distribution computation must tile and stream; do not materialize whole-canvas masks per feature.
- **Log size** — a long session can accumulate thousands of rows; virtualize and keep export streaming.
- **Undo** — deleting a row/column is a panel operation (not document undo); confirm before export-affecting deletion if CS6 does *(inferred)*.
- **GPU unavailable** — measurement is CPU-side; the log still works.

## Parity acceptance criteria

Tier is `Non-goal` for exact parity (`OVR-003`); criteria assert structure and preservation:

1. Given a scale of 50 px = 1 micron, a 50-px Ruler line records Length 1 micron and a matching Scale/Scale Units/Scale Factor.
2. Given multiple selections, one cumulative row plus one row per selection appear, each selection labelled as a distinct Feature with a unique number.
3. Given a Ruler, Count, and selection measurement, only the data points associated with each tool (plus selected Common points) appear for that measurement.
4. Given a Count measurement with the Count data point disabled, the app prompts to select data points; with it enabled, the recorded count matches the on-image total.
5. Given clearing on-image counts after recording, existing Measurement Log rows are unchanged.
6. Given selected rows and Export, a delimited UTF-8 file is written with one row per record and one column per data point; Histogram points additionally produce per-selection CSV files in a sibling folder, numbered from 0.
7. Given a column header click, the log sorts Ascending; a second click sorts Descending; rows cannot be manually reordered.
8. Given `Analysis > Place Scale Marker` with Display Text, a layer group containing a text layer and a graphic layer appears at the lower-left; deleting the group removes the marker.
9. Given a CS6 Extended PSD with measurement scale (1074) and Count Information (1080), a `Core` build opens and re-saves it with both resources preserved and reports the Measurement Log as unavailable.

## Open questions

- **Export delimiter.** The fetched CS6 text says "tab-delimited, Unicode text file" (About) and "comma-delimited text file" (export procedure). Which CS6 actually writes is unresolved. *Resolves with:* a CS6 export sample; coordinate with `10-workflow-io/measurement-and-count.md`.
- **Record schema and column set.** The exact default columns/labels per data point and whether defaults changed in CS6 are not itemized. *Resolves with:* a CS6 log screenshot and `10-workflow-io/measurement-and-count.md`.
- **Scale-marker defaults** (font, size, text position, color, opacity) are not stated. *Resolves with:* a CS6 dialog capture.
- **Rounding/precision and grayscale-profile behavior** for Gray Value/Histogram are only qualitatively described. *Resolves with:* controlled CS6 measurements.
- **Are log rows persisted in the PSD or session-only?** The fetched text implies the log is a session panel; whether rows survive save/reopen is unverified. *Resolves with:* a CS6 test.
- **Automatic-count connected-component rules** (8- vs 4-connectivity, min size) are unverified — shared with `TOOL-019`. *Resolves with:* controlled selections on CS6.
- **Does the project implement the panel at all** given the `Non-goal` tier, or only preserve resources 1074/1080 without a measurement engine? *Resolves with:* an ADR following `OVR-003`.
