# Navigator Panel

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-014`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the Navigator panel is functionally unchanged. Zoom behavior changed elsewhere (Animated Zoom and Zoom-clicked-point preferences), not in the panel.
- **Depends on:** `ARCH-003` qt6-ui-design, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`, `02-ui-ux/preferences.md`, `02-ui-ux/workspace-and-docks.md`.

> This document owns the **Navigator panel UI surface**. Zoom commands, the Zoom tool, and zoom preferences belong to `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`; document/view separation belongs to `ARCH-008` document-model. All crate, module, widget, and type names are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Facts not confirmed by a fetched CS6 source are marked *(inferred)*.

## CS6 behavior

`Window > Navigator` opens the **Navigator panel**. 

### Anatomy

From the CS6 Help figure labels (A–G):

| Label | Element |
|---|---|
| A | Panel menu button |
| B | Thumbnail display of artwork |
| C | Proxy preview area (colored box) |
| D | Zoom text box |
| E | Zoom Out button |
| F | Zoom slider |
| G | Zoom In button |

### Interactions

- **Display** — `Window > Navigator`.
- **Zoom** — 
- **Pan** — 
- **Simultaneous size + position** — "**Control-drag** (Windows) or **Command-drag** (macOS) in the image thumbnail" sets the proxy area's size and position together.
- **Proxy color** — 

### Zoom range and relationship to other zoom UI

The Zoom tool  The zoom level can also be  so the Navigator's zoom box, the status-bar zoom box, and `View > Zoom In` / `View > Zoom Out` must stay synchronized. Panel zoom is **view state**, not an image edit, and is therefore not undoable.

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Window > Navigator` | Panel | — | Opens/toggles the Navigator panel |
| Panel thumbnail | 2-D control | click / drag | Click sets viewable area; drag pans the proxy |
| Panel thumbnail | Gesture | `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-drag | Sets proxy size + position simultaneously |
| Proxy view area (colored box) | Overlay | drag | Pans the view |
| Zoom text box | Numeric entry | — | Type a magnification |
| Zoom Out button | Button | — | Steps magnification down |
| Zoom slider | Slider | — | Continuous magnification |
| Zoom In button | Button | — | Steps magnification up |
| Panel menu → Panel Options | Menu → dialog | — | Proxy color preset or custom color |
| Document status bar zoom box | Numeric entry | — | Must mirror the Navigator zoom level |
| `View > Zoom In` / `Zoom Out` | Menu | `Ctrl/Cmd` `+` / `-` *(inferred)* | Same view state as the panel |
| Zoom tool | Tool | `Z` | Preset-step zoom centered on click (`03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`) |

## Parameters & ranges

| Control | Type | Default | Range / options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zoom | percent | 100% *(inferred)* | 1 pixel effective minimum … **3200%** maximum | Text box, slider, buttons, status bar share one value |
| Zoom slider | slider | — | maps over the zoom range | Continuous |
| Zoom step (buttons) | action | — | preset percentages | Next/previous preset, matching the Zoom tool |
| Proxy color | color | a preset *(inferred)* | preset palette or custom color | Panel Options |
| Thumbnail fit | derived | fit-to-panel | — | Aspect-preserving downscale of the document |
| Proxy size | derived | view ÷ document | ≥ 1 px | Unless set by `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-drag |
| Max magnification | const | 3200% | — | Help-sourced |
| Min view size | const | 1 px | — | Help-sourced; below/at this the magnifier appears empty |

## Algorithms & pipeline

The panel is a **view controller over per-window view state**; it performs no pixel edits.

- **Thumbnail rendering** — downscale the document composite (or its cached pyramid, `ARCH-006`) to the thumbnail widget; redraw on document change, zoom, or panel resize. On very large PSB documents this must sample from the existing image pyramid rather than a fresh full-canvas reduction.
- **Proxy rectangle** — `proxy = viewport_rect / document_rect`, mapped into thumbnail coordinates; the inverse maps a thumbnail drag back to a scroll position. Clamp so the proxy stays within the thumbnail.
- **Zoom mapping** — slider position ↔ percent is a monotonic mapping over `[min, 3200%]`; the text box accepts typed values and clamps; buttons step to the next zoom preset (`03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`).
- **Control/Command-drag** — one gesture updates both the proxy size and position (a zoom-about-point plus recenter), then writes a single view-state update.
- **Synchronization** — all zoom surfaces (Navigator, status bar, `View` menu, Zoom tool) read/write one authoritative `ViewState`; updates are broadcast, never looped.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_core::view` — `ViewState { zoom: f32, scroll: Point, viewport: Rect, doc_rect: Rect }`, `zoom_to(percent)`, `pan_to(point)`, `set_proxy(rect)`; clamped constants `MIN_VIEW_PX = 1`, `MAX_ZOOM = 32.0` (3200%).
- `pictura_core::view::thumbnail` — `thumbnail_for(doc, max_size) -> ImageHandle`, reusing the image pyramid (`ARCH-006`).
- `pictura_ui_bridge::ViewportModel` — marshals `ViewState` between windows and the Navigator widget.
- `pictura_core::prefs` — proxy color, default zoom, zoom preferences (Animated Zoom, Zoom Resizes Windows, Zoom With Scroll Wheel, Zoom Clicked Point To Center) are `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`'s; the panel reads proxy color only.

Crossing types: `ViewState`, `Rect`, `Point`, `ImageHandle`, `DocumentId`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `NavigatorPanel` | `QDockWidget` | Host; thumbnail, zoom controls, panel menu |
| `NavigatorThumbnail` | custom `QWidget` | Paints the downscaled document + proxy rect; pan/click/ctrl-drag |
| `ProxyViewRect` | overlay item | Draggable/resizable proxy box drawn over the thumbnail |
| `ZoomSlider` | `QSlider` | Continuous zoom control |
| `ZoomSpinBox` | `QDoubleSpinBox` (or `QLineEdit`) | Typed zoom percentage with clamp |
| `ZoomButtons` | `QToolButton` pair | Zoom Out / Zoom In preset steps |
| `NavigatorMenu` | `QMenu` + `QColorDialog` | Panel Options → proxy color |
| `NavigatorController` | `QObject` | Binds `ViewportModel`; coalesces thumbnail repaints |

Widgets, not QML: a small, always-docked view instrument, consistent with `ARCH-003`. The thumbnail is a custom-painted `QWidget` fed by a Rust `ImageHandle`; it is intentionally cheap to repaint on pan/zoom.

## Data-model impact

- **View state is per document window**, never per-image pixel data and never serialized into the PSD (`ARCH-008`).
- **Workspace persistence:** a saved workspace may remember panel visibility/dock position, but the document's zoom/scroll is a live view property *(inferred)*.
- **Preferences:** proxy color; zoom behavior preferences are owned by `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md`.
- **Undo:** zoom/pan are **not** History states.
- **Thumbnail/cache:** runtime-only; must share the document's image pyramid, not add a second full-resolution copy.

## Edge cases

- **No document open** — empty thumbnail; zoom controls disabled or neutral.
- **Single-pixel / tiny documents** — thumbnail and proxy must render without divide-by-zero; proxy may fill the thumbnail.
- **Huge (PSB) documents** — thumbnail downscale must use the existing pyramid/cache and stay off the UI thread for the first paint.
- **3200% maximum / 1-pixel minimum** — clamp exactly; the Zoom In/Out buttons and the slider must both stop at the bounds.
- **Proxy at the document edge** — pan clamping must not let the proxy leave the thumbnail or the viewport show out-of-bounds.
- **Aspect mismatch** — thumbnail preserves aspect; the proxy mapping must account for letterboxing.
- **Rotated canvas / Rotate View tool** — the thumbnail and proxy mapping must remain consistent with the rotated view (`03-tools/rotate-view.md`).
- **Window zoom vs panel zoom** — if `Zoom Resizes Windows` is on, window resizing must update the proxy/thumbnail state without a feedback loop.
- **Multiple windows on one document** — each window's zoom/scroll is independent; the Navigator must bind to the active window.
- **Theme/high-contrast** — the proxy color must remain distinguishable from the artwork under any custom color and theme.
- **Keyboard-only** — zoom text box and buttons reachable; the thumbnail/proxy pan should have a keyboard path or documented limitation.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a document with no zoom change, the Navigator thumbnail shows the whole image with the proxy box covering the entire view.
2. Given a zoom-in via the slider, text box, or Zoom In button, the document view and the proxy box both update and stay synchronized with the status-bar zoom box.
3. Given the proxy dragged in the thumbnail, the document view pans to the corresponding region.
4. Given a click on the thumbnail, the viewable area recenters on the clicked point.
5. Given `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-drag in the thumbnail, the proxy's size and position change together in one gesture.
6. Given the zoom driven to the maximum, it stops at 3200%; given the minimum, the view reaches 1 pixel and the magnifier shows empty.
7. Given **Panel Options**, choosing a preset proxy color or a custom color recolors the proxy box and persists.
8. Given a PSB document, opening the Navigator does not allocate a second full-resolution buffer and paints from the image pyramid.
9. Given the view panned to a document edge, the proxy is clamped and no out-of-bounds area is shown.
10. Given a document rotated with Rotate View, panning in the Navigator stays consistent with the rotated viewport.
