# Clone Source Panel

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-025`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Clone Source panel and its transform/overlay controls are in both CS6 editions for Clone Stamp and Healing Brush. The video/animation frame-relationship controls are `Extended-only`.
- **New in CS6:** `No` — the panel and its controls are carried from CS5. CS6 documents it unchanged for Clone Stamp and Healing Brush; the Extended frame-relationship options remain.
- **Depends on:** `03-tools/clone-stamp-and-pattern-stamp.md` (`TOOL-030` — Clone Stamp/Pattern Stamp tool semantics, sampling model, and the same panel contract; this spec is the **panel UI**), `03-tools/healing-brushes.md` (Healing Brush shares the panel), `02-ui-ux/toolbox-and-options-bar.md`, `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-008`), `01-architecture/undo-history.md` (`ARCH-009`), `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md` (`ARCH-003`), `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md` (`ARCH-006`).

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF unless marked *(inferred)*. The panel overlaps `03-tools/clone-stamp-and-pattern-stamp.md`; this spec focuses on the panel's own surface and state.

## CS6 behavior

The **Clone Source panel** (`Window > Clone Source`) *"has options for the Clone Stamp tools or Healing Brush tools."* It lets the user keep several sampling sources and switch between them without resampling, preview the source as an overlay, and scale or rotate it to match the destination.

### Five sample sources

** Five **source buttons** select the active slot. `Alt`/`Option`-click in any open document window sets the sampling point for the selected slot; clicking a different button and sampling again defines that slot. ** Sources can come from the current document or any other open document (subject to the tool's color-mode rules in `TOOL-030`).

### Offset

Each source has an **Offset** x/y pixel value: ** Select the source, then enter the x and y values.

### Scale and rotation

- **W (width)** and **H (height)** percentage fields scale the source; **proportions are constrained by default**, with a **Maintain Aspect Ratio** button to toggle constraint or adjust dimensions independently.
- **Rotate** is entered in degrees (or scrubbed on the **Rotate The Clone Source** icon).
- **Reset Transform** restores the source to its original size and orientation.

### Flip

**Flip Horizontal** and **Flip Vertical** buttons reverse the source direction (the Help notes this is useful for mirroring features such as eyes).

### Overlay

Select **Show Overlay** to preview the source on canvas. The overlay options are:

- **Auto Hide** — hide the overlay while painting.
- **Clipped** — clip the overlay to the brush size.
- **Opacity** — percentage.
- **Blend mode** — **Normal / Darken / Lighten / Difference** (pop-up at the bottom of the panel).
- **Invert** — invert the overlay colors.

Documented alignment trick: **Opacity 50% + Invert + unclipped** makes identical source/destination areas appear **solid gray** when aligned, which helps register a clone.

**Move Source Overlay.** Hold `Alt+Shift` (`Option+Shift`) while painting with the Clone Stamp to temporarily switch to the **Move Source Overlay** tool; drag to reposition the overlay.

### Keyboard

The CS6 key tables list: **Show Clone Source (overlays image)** `Alt+Shift`/`Opt+Shift`; **Nudge Clone Source** `Alt+Shift+arrow`; **Rotate Clone Source** `Alt+Shift+<`/`>`.

### Extended-only frame relationship

*(Photoshop Extended)* For timeline-based animations the panel ** Out of core parity (`OVR-003`, `docs/02-ui-ux/panels/timeline-panel.md`).

## Algorithms & pipeline

The panel is a **controller + overlay renderer** over the clone source session; the sampling/painting pipeline is `TOOL-030`.

1. **Slot state** — a `CloneSourceSet` of five `CloneSourceSlot { anchor, transform, offset, overlay }` values. Selecting a slot rebinds the tool's active source; each slot persists until the document closes (never serialized).
2. **Source→destination mapping** — the panel edits an affine transform `T` (scale Sx/Sy, rotation θ, flips) plus an explicit `(offset_x, offset_y)`. For a destination dab centre `d`, the sampled source point is `src = T⁻¹(d − offset) − anchor_delta` per the aligned/non-aligned rule in `TOOL-030`.
3. **Overlay render** — draw the transformed source under/over the canvas with the overlay blend mode, opacity, optional clip-to-brush and invert; `Auto Hide` suppresses it during a stroke. The 50%+Invert effect falls out of the standard `Difference`-style math when source and destination match.
4. **Move Source Overlay** — `Alt+Shift` swaps the tool to a transient overlay-drag mode that edits the offset/transform without sampling pixels.
5. **Reset Transform** — restore an identity transform for the selected slot.

Because the mapping is a pure affine transform on the sample view, the panel can preview cheaply and the GPU overlay (`ARCH-006`) can share the same transform.

## Rust module mapping

Consistent with `TOOL-030`:

- `pictura_retouch::clone::CloneSourceSlot` — `{ anchor: Point, transform: Affine2D, offset: (i32, i32), overlay: OverlaySettings }`.
- `pictura_retouch::clone::CloneSourceSet` — fixed 5-element slot array + active index; `select(slot)`, `reset_transform(slot)`, `set_anchor(slot, point)`.
- `pictura_retouch::clone::OverlaySettings` — `{ show, auto_hide, clipped, opacity, mode: OverlayMode, invert }`; `OverlayMode { Normal, Darken, Lighten, Difference }`.
- `pictura_retouch::clone::SampleSurface` — resolves a slot's source surface (shared with Healing Brush).
- `pictura_render::sample::BilinearSampler` / `pictura_transform::Affine2D` — shared mapping types.

Crossing types: `CloneSourceId(u8)`, `Affine2D`, `OverlayMode`, `Point`. No Qt types cross into `pictura_retouch`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `CloneSourcePanel` | `QDockWidget` | Host; five slot buttons, transform/offset fields, overlay controls |
| `CloneSourceModel` | `QAbstractListModel`/`QObject` | Five `CloneSourceSlot` values + active slot; notifies via the Rust bridge |
| `SourceSlotBar` | `QToolButton` group | Source 1–5 selection |
| `TransformFields` | `QDoubleSpinBox` + toggle buttons | W/H/rotate/flip; Maintain Aspect Ratio; Reset Transform |
| `OverlayControls` | `QCheckBox` + slider + combo | Show/Auto Hide/Clipped/Opacity/mode/Invert |
| `SourceOverlayItem` | `QGraphicsItem` (vector overlay) | Draws the transformed source overlay next to the GPU canvas; Move Source Overlay drag |

Widgets over QML for the docked form controls (`ARCH-003`); the overlay is a vector `QGraphicsItem` over the composited canvas, sharing the slot's `Affine2D`, so it never writes pixels itself.

## Data-model impact

- **No PSD fields.** All clone-source state (slots, anchors, transforms, offsets, overlay settings) is **tool session state**, saved only until the document closes. Nothing is serialized (`TOOL-030`).
- **Undo.** Transform/offset/overlay edits are tool state and are not document history. The paint stroke itself is one `PaintStroke` command with pre-edit pixel backups (`ARCH-009`).
- **Pattern Stamp** is a separate tool path that uses a pattern id, not a clone source slot (`TOOL-030`); the panel does not apply to it.
- **Video/animation frame relationship** (when implemented) is timeline state, not clone-panel document data; it must not leak into the PSD as clone state.
- **Preferred source per document** is session-only; whether CS6 restores it per workspace is unverified.

## Edge cases

- **Cross-document sampling** must respect the same color-mode rule as the tool (`TOOL-030`); the panel disables/greys slots whose source becomes invalid.
- **Source document closed** — a slot referencing a closed document must invalidate gracefully, not paint from stale memory.
- **Slot persistence** — exactly "until the document is closed"; a new document starts with empty slots. Closing/reopening a document clears them.
- **Zero/negative scale**, `W`/`H` = 0, or extreme rotation must not divide by zero in the inverse transform.
- **Maintain Aspect Ratio** — editing W updates H (and vice versa) when constrained; independent editing when not.
- **Overlay on a 1-px/empty document** — overlay bounds may be empty; nothing crashes.
- **Clipped + small brush** — overlay clipped to a tiny brush must not produce a zero-size draw error.
- **Opacity 0** — overlay hidden but settings retained.
- **32-bit / CMYK / Lab** — the mode-independent affine mapping applies; the sampler works in the document's channel model (`TOOL-030`).
- **Huge PSB** — overlay must sample tiles lazily; never copy the whole source surface for the overlay.
- **GPU unavailable** — overlay draws on the CPU vector layer; painting still works via the CPU sampler.
- **Aligned/non-aligned interaction** — changing `Aligned` mid-session must not silently corrupt the slot's anchor semantics; the transform/offset remain the panel's, the anchor rule is the tool's.
- **Extended frame controls** — absent in a core build; must be hidden, not shown broken.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given five sampled sources, clicking each source button selects that sampling point without resampling; painting from each uses its slot's pixels.
2. Given the document is closed and a new one opened, all five sources are cleared (session-only persistence).
3. Given `W`/`H` changed with Maintain Aspect Ratio on, the other dimension follows; toggling it off allows independent values; **Reset Transform** restores 100%/100%/0°.
4. Given a rotation value, painted clones match the rotated source within the sampling tolerance; Flip Horizontal/Vertical mirrors the source.
5. Given an Offset x/y, the sampled source is shifted by exactly that pixel offset in the destination.
6. Given `Show Overlay` with Opacity 50%, Invert on, and Clipped off, identical source and destination regions render as solid gray.
7. Given `Clipped` on, the overlay is confined to the brush footprint; given `Auto Hide`, the overlay is hidden during the stroke.
8. Given `Alt+Shift` held with the Clone Stamp, the cursor becomes Move Source Overlay and dragging repositions the overlay without painting.
9. Given `Alt+Shift+<`/`>` or `Alt+Shift+arrow`, the clone source rotates or nudges per the CS6 key table.
10. Given the Clone Source panel used with the Healing Brush, the same slot/transform/overlay state applies.

## Open questions

- **Exact overlay opacity default** (100% assumed) and whether the panel remembers per-slot overlay settings independently. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture.
- **Overlay blend-mode math** — the four modes presumably reuse standard blend formulas; not confirmed for the overlay (`TOOL-030` shares this question).
- **Sampling interpolation** (bilinear/bicubic/nearest) under scale/rotate is undocumented (`TOOL-030`).
- **Source-slot persistence granularity** — "until the document is closed" is stated; whether a workspace/session restores slots is unverified.
- **Move Source Overlay's exact effect** — does dragging change the stored Offset x/y, the anchor, or both? *Resolves with:* a CS6 test.
- **Extended frame-relationship UI** — exact controls and behavior for video/animation frames are out of core parity (`OVR-003`) and not detailed here.
- **Invalid-slot invalidation rules** when a sampled source document is closed or its color mode changes. *Resolves with:* a CS6 test.
