# Adjustments Panel

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-005`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (individual adjustment types have their own tiers; 32-bit adjustment layers are Extended-only — `LAY-012`).
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 keeps the adjustment **icons always visible** in the Adjustments panel and moves the **adjustment presets** out of the panel into a **Presets menu in the Properties panel** (presets for Levels, Curves, Exposure, Hue/Saturation, Black & White, Channel Mixer, Selective Color). Clicking an icon still both selects the adjustment and creates an adjustment layer; the actual parameter controls now live in the Properties panel, not the Adjustments panel.
- **Depends on:** `LAY-012` adjustment-layers, `LAY-013` fill-layers, `ADJ-000` adjustments-overview, the per-adjustment specs under `04-image-ops/adjustments/`, `LAY-010` blend-modes, `ARCH-008` document-model, `ARCH-009` undo-history, `ARCH-003` qt6-ui-design, `PAN-006` properties-panel.

> Crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Adjustment math is owned by `04-image-ops/`; layer semantics are owned by `LAY-012`; this file specifies the **panel widget and the create/animate flow**.

## CS6 behavior

The **Adjustments panel** (`Window > Adjustments`) gathers the color and tonal adjustments.  The adjustments made through the panel are therefore **non-destructive** — they live on an adjustment layer and can be re-edited or discarded without changing underlying pixels (`LAY-012`).

In **CS5** the panel had a presets list and showed a separate icon screen; in **CS6**:

- the **adjustment icons are always visible**, so the panel is a launch grid;
- the **parameter controls are shown in the Properties panel** (CS5 showed them in the Adjustments panel);
- the **presets list moved to a Presets menu in the Properties panel** for the adjustment selected;
- the panel can be widened by dragging a bottom corner (CS5 had an Expand View button).

Clicking an adjustment icon (or choosing an adjustment from the panel menu) creates the adjustment layer and opens its settings in the Properties panel. The panel then exposes the same per-layer affordances as `LAY-012`:

- **Toggle Layer Visibility** — show/hide the adjustment layer.
- **Reset** — return the adjustment to its original settings.
- **Delete This Adjustment Layer** — discard the adjustment.
- **Clip to Layer** — confine the adjustment to the layer below (click again to apply to all layers below); equivalently `Layer > Create Clipping Mask` / `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`Alt`+`G`.

The panel menu also offers `Auto-Select Parameter` and `Auto-Select Targeted Adjustment Tool`, which make text fields / the on-image targeted adjustment tool the default focus (`LAY-012`). Adjustment-panel channel shortcuts mirror the Layers/Channels conventions: `Alt`/`Option`+`2` selects the composite channel and `Alt`/`Option`+`3/4/5` red/green/blue, with the legacy `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`1/2/3` scheme available through `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts > Use Legacy Channel Shortcuts`; `Delete`/`Backspace` deletes the adjustment layer.

### Adjustment type grid

The visible adjustments (16 types; PSD keys and parameters in `LAY-012`):

`Brightness/Contrast`, `Levels`, `Curves`, `Exposure`, `Vibrance`, `Hue/Saturation`, `Color Balance`, `Black & White`, `Photo Filter`, `Channel Mixer`, `Color Lookup`, `Invert`, `Posterize`, `Threshold`, `Gradient Map`, `Selective Color` — plus the three **fill-layer** types `Solid Color`, `Gradient`, `Pattern` (`LAY-013`), which share the create flow but add content instead of transforming the backdrop.

**Color Lookup** is CS6-new (community-sourced; the fetched CS6 Help prose does not name it) and the PSD spec carries the `clrL` key. **Invert** has no editable settings; the Properties panel shows a read-only state for it. Availability is gated by document color mode and bit depth (`LAY-012`): bitmap/indexed disallow adjustment layers, and 32-bit adjustment layers are Extended-only.

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Window > Adjustments` | Menu → panel | — | Display the panel; icons always visible in CS6. |
| Panel icon grid | Buttons | — | Click creates an adjustment layer and opens Properties. |
| Panel menu | Menu | — | Choose adjustment; `Auto-Select Parameter`; `Auto-Select Targeted Adjustment Tool`; `Save Preset` (CS5 list; CS6 uses Properties Presets). |
| Panel corner | Resize | drag | Widen the panel (CS6). |
| Properties panel | Contextual controls | — | Parameter editor + Presets menu + Clip to Layer (`PAN-006`). |
| Layers panel New Adjustment Layer button | Button/menu | — | Alternative create path (`PAN-001`, `LAY-002`). |
| `Layer > New Adjustment Layer` | Menu | — | Submenu of all types; New Layer dialog. |
| `Layer > New Fill Layer` | Menu | — | Solid Color / Gradient / Pattern (`LAY-013`). |
| `Layer > Layer Content Options` | Menu | — | Re-edit the selected adjustment/fill layer. |
| Clip to Layer button | Button | — | Toggles clipping (`LAY-012`). |
| Adjustment channel shortcuts | Keys | `Alt/Option+2`, `Alt/Option+3/4/5` | Legacy `Ctrl/Cmd+1/2/3` via preference. |
| Delete adjustment layer | Key | `Delete` / `Backspace` | Deletes the selected adjustment layer. |

## Parameters & ranges

The panel itself has few controls; the adjustments' parameters are owned per type.

| Control | Type | Default | Range / options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Adjustment type | enum | none | 16 adjustment types + 3 fill types | Fixed at creation (`LAY-012`). |
| Presets menu | enum | none | Levels, Curves, Exposure, Hue/Saturation, B&W, Channel Mixer, Selective Color | CS6: in the **Properties** panel, not here. |
| Auto-Select Parameter | bool | off | on / off | Focus text fields automatically. |
| Auto-Select Targeted Adjustment Tool | bool | off | on / off | Default to the on-image tool. |
| Clip to Layer | bool | off | on / off | Confine to the layer below. |
| Reset | action | — | — | Restore original settings. |
| Toggle Layer Visibility | bool | on | on / off | Per-layer visibility. |
| Delete | action | — | — | Discard the adjustment layer. |
| Panel width | px | default | draggable | CS6 corner drag. |

Per-adjustment parameters (e.g. Levels input/output/gamma; Curves points; Hue/Saturation ranges; Color Lookup `3DLUT File`/`Abstract`/`Device Link`) are owned by `04-image-ops/adjustments/*` and `LAY-012`.

## Algorithms & pipeline

The panel is a **launcher**: it creates a layer and hands editing to the Properties panel. It owns no adjustment math.

1. **Create.** Clicking an icon sends a `NewAdjustmentLayer { kind }` command; the command layer inserts an `Adjustment { params }` node above the active layer, applies a default mask (built from the selection/path if present, `LAY-012`), and selects it.
2. **Edit.** The Properties panel binds to the selected node and edits `AdjustmentParams`; each parameter change is a command with an undo record (`ARCH-009`). The composition pipeline re-runs the adjustment pass on dirty tiles (`LAY-012`).
3. **Clip/reset/delete/visibility.** Thin wrappers over `LAY-012` commands.
4. **Presets.** CS6 reads/writes presets through the Properties panel's Presets menu; the Adjustments panel has no preset UI. Preset application creates/updates the adjustment layer.
5. **Gating.** The icon grid enables/disables entries by color mode, bit depth and edition (32-bit Extended-only).

## Rust module mapping

Design proposal; adjustment data and kernels already exist (`LAY-012`, `ADJ-000`).

- `pictura_core::node::AdjustmentParams` — enum, one variant per adjustment (`ARCH-008`).
- `pictura_core::document::adjustment_ops` — `NewAdjustmentLayer { kind, clip, mask_from }`, `SetAdjustmentParams`, `ResetAdjustment`, `SetAdjustmentVisibility`, `DeleteAdjustment`, `SetClipping`.
- `pictura_adjust` — adjustment kernels and typed parameter structs (`LAY-012`); `pictura_adjust::preset` for the seven preset-capable types.
- `pictura_core::edition` — `Edition` gate for 32-bit adjustments.
- `pictura_ui_bridge::AdjustmentCatalog` — the ordered icon list with per-entry availability `{ kind, label, icon, enabled, reason }`, crossing to Qt.

Crossing types: `AdjustmentKind`, `AdjustmentParams`, `Edition`, `ColorMode`, `BitDepth`. No Qt types in `pictura_core`.

## Qt6 component mapping

Widgets (consistent with `ARCH-003`).

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `AdjustmentsPanel` | `QDockWidget` | Host; resizable icon grid + panel menu. |
| `AdjustmentIconGrid` | `QListView` (icon mode) / `QToolButton` flow | Always-visible icons; click ⇒ create command. |
| `AdjustmentCatalogModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | Icon/label/enabled roles from `AdjustmentCatalog`. |
| `AdjustmentIconDelegate` | `QStyledItemDelegate` | Icon, hover/press, disabled tooltip. |
| `AdjustmentsPanelMenu` | `QMenu` | Choose adjustment; auto-select options. |
| `PropertiesPanel` (`PAN-006`) | `QDockWidget` | Parameter editor, Presets menu, Clip to Layer, Reset/Delete/Toggle. |
| `FillLayerDialogs` | `QDialog` | Solid Color / Gradient / Pattern create dialogs (`LAY-013`). |

The parameter editors (`LevelsEditor`, `CurvesEditor`, `HueSaturationEditor`, `ColorLookupEditor`, …) live in the Properties panel (`PAN-006`) and are shared with `04-image-ops/`.

## Data-model impact

- **No new persistent fields** beyond `LAY-012`: the panel creates existing `Adjustment`/`Fill` nodes.
- **Adjustment presets** are external assets/preferences, not document data, except the chosen Color Lookup LUT identity inside `clrL` (`LAY-012`).
- **Auto-select preferences** are application preferences.
- **Undo:** creation, parameter edits, clipping, visibility, reset and delete are commands (`ARCH-009`); live slider drags coalesce into one state.
- **Panel state** (last-used adjustment, panel width) is workspace/preference data, not document data.

## Edge cases

- **Unsupported adjustment for the mode:** bitmap/indexed disable all adjustment-layer icons; 32-bit Standard disables 32-bit-capable adjustments; the tooltip must explain why.
- **No layers below / adjustment at bottom:** creation succeeds but has no visible effect (`LAY-012`).
- **Invert:** has no editable settings; the Properties panel must show a read-only state, and the Adjustments panel must not present phantom controls.
- **Smart Object / no selection:** mask creation follows `LAY-012` (white mask, or selection/path-derived).
- **Color Lookup LUT missing:** degrade gracefully and report; do not crash (`LAY-012`).
- **Panel overflow:** a narrow dock must scroll or wrap the icon grid without hiding entries.
- **Undo across panel:** creating then immediately deleting an adjustment must net to no layer with a clean history.
- **GPU unavailable:** adjustments run on the CPU fallback (`LAY-012`).

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given CS6, `Window > Adjustments` shows the always-visible icon grid; clicking an icon creates an adjustment layer and opens its settings in the Properties panel.
2. Given each of the 16 adjustment types and 3 fill types, clicking its icon creates the matching layer type with a default mask (`LAY-012`).
3. Given a pixel selection before creating an adjustment, the new layer's mask matches the selection; given a selected path, a vector mask is created (`LAY-012`).
4. Given a CS6 build, no preset list is shown in the Adjustments panel; the seven preset-capable adjustments expose presets through the Properties panel Presets menu.
5. Given `Clip to Layer`, the adjustment affects only the layer below; clicking again applies it to all layers below.
6. Given `Reset`, the selected adjustment returns to its created defaults; given `Toggle Layer Visibility`, the composite toggles; given `Delete`/`Backspace`, the layer is removed.
7. Given `Auto-Select Parameter` / `Auto-Select Targeted Adjustment Tool` on, the corresponding control is focused by default.
8. Given `Alt`/`Option+2` and `Alt`/`Option+3/4/5`, composite/R/G/B channels are selected; with legacy shortcuts enabled, `Ctrl`/`Cmd+1/2/3` behave as R/G/B.
9. Given a 32-bit document in Standard edition, 32-bit adjustment creation is unavailable; in Extended it is available for the supported types.
10. Given an Invert adjustment, the Properties panel presents no editable parameters.

## Open questions

- **Color Lookup in the CS6 Help.** The fetched Help prose does not name Color Lookup in the Adjustments panel although it is CS6-new (community) and the PSD spec has `clrL`; whether the Help omission reflects the actual icon grid needs a capture. *Resolves with:* a CS6 Adjustments-panel screenshot.
- **Exact icon order/count in CS6.** The Help does not enumerate the grid; the 16+3 list is assembled from `LAY-012` and community sources. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture.
- **Properties panel vs Adjustments panel split for presets** is sourced for the named seven types; whether any adjustment also kept an in-panel preset affordance is not. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture.
- **Default `Auto-Select Parameter` / `Auto-Select Targeted Adjustment Tool` states** are not stated. *Resolves with:* a preferences dump.
- **Fill-layer create path from this panel** (Solid/Gradient/Pattern have their own icons vs only the `Layer > New Fill Layer` menu) is not explicit in the fetched text. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture and `LAY-013`.
- **32-bit availability per adjustment** is delegated to `LAY-012` / `04-image-ops/32-bit-hdr.md`.
