# Tool Presets Panel

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-020`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — the Tool Presets panel, the options-bar Tool Preset picker, and tool presets inside the Preset Manager ship in both CS6 editions.
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — the panel UI is carried from CS5, but the CS6 JDI list records **"Reorganized tool presets remain after restart"** and the CS6 SDK adds scripting access to the tool name associated with a tool preset. No new panel controls are documented in the fetched CS6 Help text.
- **Depends on:** `BRU-006` `07-color-painting/brush-presets.md` (brush vs. tool preset boundary), `10-workflow-io/presets-manager.md` (Preset Manager / library I/O), `02-ui-ux/toolbox-and-options-bar.md` (options bar host), `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md` (`ARCH-003`, dock/model-view), `01-architecture/rust-core-design.md` (`ARCH-002`), `03-tools/type-tools.md` (`TOOL-050`, type tool presets).

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF; anything inferred is marked *(inferred)*. The tool-preset **file format and extension are not documented by the fetched CS6 text** (see Open questions).

## CS6 behavior

A **tool preset** stores a tool plus its options-bar settings so the combination can be recalled without reconfiguring the tool. The CS6 Help definition: **

Three surfaces expose the same preset list:

1. **Tool Preset picker** — the options-bar pop-up, left of the tool icon.
2. **Tool Presets panel** — `Window > Tool Presets`.
3. **Preset Manager** — `Edit > Presets > Preset Manager`, Preset Type = Tools (`10-workflow-io/presets-manager.md`).

**Choosing a preset.** ** Selecting a preset changes the active tool's options to the preset and ** Selecting a preset for a tool other than the active one also switches the active tool (documented picker behavior; the panel's all-presets list is used this way). *(The exact wording for tool switching is from the panel documentation and evident behavior; mark inferred.)*

**Creating.** Choose a tool and set its options bar, then either click the **Tool Preset button** at the left of the options bar, use `Window > Tool Presets` → **Create New Tool Preset** button, or **New Tool Preset** from the panel menu; enter a name and click **OK**.

**Current tool vs. all tools.** The pop-up panel menu offers **Show All Tool Presets**, **Sort By Tool**, and **Show Current Tool Presets**; the panel's bottom-left **Current Tool Only** checkbox is the same filter. Display modes are **Text Only**, **Small List**, and **Large List** in the pop-up panel (the Preset Manager adds thumbnail modes; see `10-workflow-io/presets-manager.md`).

**Managing.** **Rename Tool Preset** and **Delete Tool Preset** are pop-up-panel menu commands; the Preset Manager can rename/delete/reorder items. Library commands are **Load Tool Presets** (append), **Replace Tool Presets**, **Reset Tool Presets** (replace or append the defaults), and **Save Tool Presets** (write the current list to a file). Placing a saved library in the default `Presets/Tools` folder makes it appear at the bottom of the panel menu after restart. *(The exact folder name follows the CS6 `Presets/` convention documented for brushes; the tool-specific subfolder name is inferred.)*

**Tool preset vs. brush preset.** Help distinguishes the two: save a **tool preset** ** Brush presets and their `.abr` libraries are a separate namespace (`BRU-006`); this panel owns the tool-plus-options bundle only. A tool preset can capture **type tool settings** (font, size, attributes, color) as well.

**CS6 scripting note.** The CS6 SDK adds the ability to access the tool name associated with a tool preset name via scripting — relevant to `09-automation/` and to how the model identifies the owning tool, not to visible panel UI.

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Options bar — Tool Preset picker | Pop-up panel button | — | Left of the tool icon; primary entry point |
| Options bar — Tool Preset button | Button | — | Opens/creates a preset next to the tool |
| `Window > Tool Presets` | Menu → dock panel | — | Tool Presets panel |
| Panel bottom-left | Checkbox | — | `Current Tool Only` / `Show Current Tool Presets` |
| Panel pop-up menu | Menu | — | New/Rename/Delete; Show All / Sort By Tool / Show Current Tool; Text Only / Small List / Large List; Load/Replace/Reset/Save Tool Presets |
| Panel bottom-left | Create New Tool Preset button | — | Opens the name dialog |
| Preset Manager | Dialog | `Edit > Presets > Preset Manager` | Preset Type = Tools; load/replace/rename/delete/reorder |
| Filesystem | Files | — | `Presets/Tools/*` (extension not documented); panel-menu library entry after restart |

## Parameters & ranges

| Control | Type | Default | Range / options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preset name | string | tool-derived | — | New Tool Preset dialog |
| Owning tool | tool ref | active tool | CS6 tool set | Set at creation; drives Current Tool filter |
| Captured options | tool config | current options bar | tool-dependent | Mode/opacity/flow/color/brush tip, crop size, type attributes, etc. |
| List filter | bool | off | Current Tool Only / Show All | Panel checkbox and pop-up label are the same state |
| Sort | enum | list order | Sort By Tool / manual | Preset Manager also supports drag-reorder |
| Display mode | enum | Small List *(assumed)* | Text Only / Small List / Large List (+ Preset Manager thumbnails) | Pop-up panel; CS6 default not stated |
| Function/shortcut | — | — | — | Not documented for tool presets (actions own function keys) |

## Algorithms & pipeline

The panel is a **model/view over a preset library**; it owns no image algorithms.

1. **Capture** — read the active tool id plus the current options-bar state and serialize it into a `ToolPreset { tool, name, options }`. *(inferred)* Options are an enum-tagged parameter block keyed by tool kind, so a type-tool preset and a crop-tool preset share no fields.
2. **Apply** — on selection, resolve the owning tool, switch the active tool if necessary, and push the stored option block into the tool's state. The preset **, i.e. applying a preset is sticky until reset/another preset.
3. **Filter/sort** — `current_tool_only` filters by owning tool; `sort_by_tool` groups by tool id.
4. **Persist** — session-created presets live in the preferences store; durable libraries are written by **Save Tool Presets** and read by **Load/Replace/Reset**. *(inferred: the CS6 text describes the commands but not the container format.)*

Tool switching and option application must go through the same command/active-tool service the options bar uses, so the panel cannot leave the toolbar and options bar out of sync.

## Rust module mapping

Proposals, consistent with `BRU-006`:

- `pictura_presets::tool::ToolPreset` — `{ id: ToolPresetId, tool: ToolId, name: String, options: ToolOptions }`.
- `pictura_presets::tool::ToolOptions` — enum-tagged per-tool parameter block (crop, type, brush, marquee, eyedropper, …).
- `pictura_presets::tool::ToolPresetLibrary` — ordered list; `filter_current_tool(tool)`, `sort_by_tool()`, `create/rename/delete`, `load/replace/reset/save`.
- `pictura_presets::prefs::PreferencesStore` — session persistence of newly created presets (shared with `BRU-006`).
- `pictura_ui_bridge::ActiveTool` — read/push the options-bar tool state; the panel applies presets through this service.

Crossing types: `ToolPresetId`, `ToolId`, `ToolOptions`, and small option structs. No Qt types cross into `pictura_presets`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ToolPresetsPanel` | `QDockWidget` | Host; list display, Current Tool Only, bottom buttons, panel menu |
| `ToolPresetModel` | `QAbstractListModel` | Presets + owning tool + display name; filter/sort proxy |
| `ToolPresetProxy` | `QSortFilterProxyModel` | Current Tool Only / Sort By Tool |
| `ToolPresetPicker` | `QComboBox` pop-up / `QToolButton` | Options-bar picker; shared model with the panel |
| `NewToolPresetDialog` | `QDialog` | Name entry; create/rename |
| `PresetManagerDialog` | `QDialog` | Tools tab: load/replace/rename/delete/reorder (shared with `10-workflow-io/presets-manager.md`) |

Widgets over QML (dense docked list, model/view; `ARCH-003`). Preset thumbnails are rendered by the Rust tool/brush renderer and surfaced as `QImage`; list and picker share one model so they stay in sync.

## Data-model impact

- **No PSD fields.** Tool presets are application/preset-library state and are never serialized into the document. No PSD or XMP impact.
- **Preferences.** Newly created presets are stored in the preferences file; a preferences reset drops unsaved presets (CS6 behavior), so the UI should warn before a reset/replace.
- **Undo.** Preset create/rename/delete/reorder are not document history states; they are app-state operations. Applying a preset that changes tool options is also not an undoable document edit.
- **Namespaces.** Tool presets, brush presets (`BRU-006`), and other preset kinds are separate libraries and must not be conflated in storage or in the Preset Manager tabs.
- **Forward compatibility.** Preserve unknown per-tool option fields on read so a preset authored by a newer build survives a re-save *(inferred)*.

## Edge cases

- **Preset for another tool selected in the all-presets view** — must switch the active tool and update the options bar consistently.
- **Deleted/undefined preset library** — opening a missing library reports an error; never silently empties the list.
- **Preferences reset** — warn that unsaved tool presets will be lost.
- **Duplicate names** — disambiguate on load/create; do not silently overwrite.
- **Tool removed/changed** — a preset whose owning tool/option no longer exists must report the mismatch rather than apply a partial state.
- **Type tool presets** — must carry font, size, attributes, and color (`03-tools/type-tools.md`); a missing font on apply follows the type-tool fallback path.
- **Current Tool Only + no presets for the active tool** — show the documented empty state rather than a stale list.
- **Reordering** — CS6 JDI says reorganized tool presets persist across restart; ordering must be stored, not recomputed.
- **Non-ASCII names** — preset names must round-trip in the preferences/library store.
- **Preset library inside vs. outside the default folder** — loads either way; only the default folder yields a panel-menu restart entry.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a brush tool configured with a tip, opacity, flow, and color, `Create New Tool Preset` adds a named preset that reappears in both the panel and the options-bar picker.
2. Given a tool preset selected, the options bar shows the captured settings, and after switching to another tool and back the preset's settings are still applied until `Reset Tool`.
3. Given **Current Tool Only** on, the panel lists only presets whose owning tool is active; off, it lists all loaded presets.
4. Given **Sort By Tool**, presets are grouped/ordered by their owning tool.
5. Given `Save Tool Presets`, then `Reset Tool Presets`, then `Load Tool Presets`, the saved presets are restored (append semantics).
6. Given a library placed in the default `Presets` folder, its name appears at the bottom of the panel menu after restart.
7. Given CS6 JDI behavior, reordering presets and restarting the application preserves the new order.
8. Given a renamed or deleted preset, the change is reflected in the panel, the picker, and the Preset Manager.
9. Given a type-tool preset, applying it restores font family/style/size/attributes/color.

## Open questions

- **Tool-preset file format and extension.** The CS6 text documents **Save Tool Presets** but not the container; the `.tpl` extension is community lore and not confirmed here. *Resolves with:* a CS6-saved tool-preset file and the Preset Manager / file-format reference.
- **Default `Presets` subfolder name for tools** is inferred from the brush convention (`Presets/Brushes`). *Resolves with:* a CS6 install listing.
- **Default display mode** (Small List vs. Small Thumbnail) on a fresh install is not stated. *Resolves with:* a CS6 UI capture.
- **Which options are captured per tool** (the exact capture matrix) is only exemplified (brush, crop, type) in the fetched text. *Resolves with:* per-tool captures on CS6.
- **Does selecting an all-presets list entry always switch tools** in CS6, and does it warn about discarding current tool edits? *Resolves with:* a CS6 test.
- **Serialization of the owning tool id** for scripting (`tool name associated with the preset`). *Resolves with:* the CS6 Scripting/ExtendScript reference and `09-automation/extendscript-api-surface.md`.
