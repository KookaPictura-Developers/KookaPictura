# Smart Object and Mask Panels

- **Spec ID:** `PAN-026`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` — layer masks, vector masks, Smart Objects, and Smart Filters are in both CS6 editions. Image-stack Stack Modes (a Smart Object surface) are `Extended-only`.
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — the CS5 **Masks panel was retired** and its controls moved into the new **Properties panel** (mask mode; `PAN-006`). Clicking the mask thumbnail in the Layers panel now activates the mask (CS5 used the Masks-panel Pixel Mask button). CS6 also enables **Invert** and **Threshold** for masks in 32-bit/channel images, and adds two new smart-filter-capable filters (**Blur Gallery**, **Oil Paint**). The CS5 Help's "Masks panel (CS6)" wording survives in the CS6 PDF as an artifact (see Open questions).
- **Depends on:** `PAN-006` `02-ui-ux/panels/properties-panel.md` (the contextual router; **this spec is the mask/smart-object relationship surface, not a second panel**), `PAN-001` `02-ui-ux/panels/layers-panel.md` (mask/smart-filter thumbnails and badges), `LAY-004` `05-layers/layer-masks.md`, `LAY-005` `05-layers/vector-masks-and-clipping-masks.md`, `LAY-020` `05-layers/smart-objects.md`, `LAY-021` `05-layers/smart-filters.md`, `SEL-003` `08-selection/refine-edge.md`, `SEL-005` `08-selection/color-range.md`, `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-008`), `01-architecture/undo-history.md` (`ARCH-009`).

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository. Behavior is taken from the fetched CS6 Help PDF unless marked *(inferred)*. The mask and Smart Object **semantics** are owned by `LAY-004`/`LAY-005`/`LAY-020`/`LAY-021`; this file specifies the **UI surfaces and the Properties-panel mask/property relationship**.

## CS6 behavior

### The Mask panel is the Properties panel in mask mode

CS6 has **no separate Masks panel**. Its controls were amalgamated into the **Properties panel** (`PAN-006`), which is a contextual router: the page it shows follows the current selection. The CS6 Help describes the controls with duality wording — the Properties panel (CS6) or the Masks panel (CS5) provides further controls for adjusting a mask — and its figure caption still reads *"Masks panel (CS5) and Properties panel (CS6)"*.

**Activating mask mode.** Click the **mask thumbnail** in the Layers panel; a border appears around the active thumbnail and the Properties panel swaps to the mask controls. Clicking the layer thumbnail returns the panel to layer content. *(The Help's figure also shows a mask/vector-mask/filter-mask selector and buttons A–G: select filter mask, add pixel mask, add vector mask, panel menu, Apply Mask, layer mask, vector mask.)*

**Mask controls (documented):**

- **Density** — mask opacity. At **100%** the mask is fully opaque and blocks the underlying area; lowering density reveals more of the area under the mask.
- **Feather** — blurs the mask edges for a softer transition, applied from the mask edges outward within the set pixel range.
- **Invert** — reverses masked/unmasked areas (layer masks only, not vector masks). CS6 enables Invert (and **Threshold**) for masks in 32-bit/channel images.
- **Mask Edge** — opens the **Refine Mask** dialog, the same option set as Refine Edge (`SEL-003`): View Mode, Refine/Erase Radius brushes, Smart Radius, Radius, Smooth, Feather, Contrast, Shift Edge, Decontaminate Colors (+ Amount), Output To. **Decontaminate Colors changes pixel color** and forces output to a new layer/document.
- **Color Range** — confines/refines the mask by sampled color (`SEL-005`).
- **Disable/Enable Mask** — the eye icon toggles the mask without deleting it; a red X overlays the Layers-panel thumbnail when disabled.
- **Apply Mask** / **Delete** — apply the mask permanently to the layer, or delete it without applying. **A layer mask cannot be permanently applied when deleting it on a Smart Object layer.**
- **Vector Mask** controls — add reveal-all/hide-all and delete for vector masks (`LAY-005`), shared with the Paths panel.
- **Add Mask by Default** — the Adjustments/Properties panel menu controls whether adjustment/fill layers auto-receive a mask (`LAY-004`).

**Display and rubylith** are driven from the Layers-panel thumbnail (`Alt`/`Option`-click = grayscale mask; `Alt+Shift`/`Option+Shift`-click = rubylith overlay; double-click the mask channel for **Layer Mask Display Options**), owned by `LAY-004`.

### Smart Object UI surfaces

A Smart Object is a container layer (badge on its thumbnail) that renders an embedded/linked source through a transform and a Smart Filter stack (`LAY-020`, `LAY-021`). Its UI surfaces are distributed, not a single panel:

- **Layers panel** — the Smart Object badge, the layer mask thumbnail, and, nested under the layer, the **Smart Filter stack** rows (each Smart Filter shows its own **filter-mask thumbnail**, blend mode, and opacity). Double-clicking the layer thumbnail = **Edit Contents**.
- **`Layer > Smart Objects` menu** — Convert to Smart Object, New Smart Object Via Copy, Edit Contents, Replace Contents, Export Contents, Stack Mode (Extended), Rasterize (`LAY-020`).
- **Properties panel (proposed page; `PAN-006` open question)** — a contextual Smart Object page summarizing the source (format, page, embedded/linked), with **Edit/Replace/Export Contents**, **Rasterize**, and the Extended **Stack Mode** selector. The fetched CS6 Help does **not** document a dedicated Smart Object Properties page; treat this as *(inferred)* and consistent with the contextual-panel concept, not as a sourced CS6 contract.
- **`File > Place` / `Open As Smart Object`** — placement workflows that create the object (`LAY-020`).
- **`Filter` menu** — smart-compatible filters apply non-destructively to the selected Smart Object (CS6 adds Blur Gallery and Oil Paint to the smart-capable set per `LAY-021`).

### Smart Filter and filter-mask surface

Smart Filters appear under the Smart Object layer. The CS6 Help (in CS5-era wording that names the Masks panel) documents the filter-mask surface:

- **Filter mask** — like a layer mask, a filter mask can be painted. Black paint hides the filter's effect, white paint reveals it, and gray paint yields partial transparency.
- **Density / Feather / Invert** — the Masks panel controls set the filter mask's density, add feathering along its edges, or invert it. (In CS6 these are the Properties-panel mask controls.)
- **Mask Edge is not available for filter masks.**
- **Enable/disable** — Shift-click the filter-mask thumbnail, or the Disable/Enable Mask button; a red X appears when disabled.
- **Move/copy** — drag a filter mask to another Smart Filter Effect; `Alt`/`Option`-drag copies it.
- **Delete** — the Delete icon, dragging the thumbnail to the Delete icon, or `Layer > Smart Filters > Delete Filter Mask`.
- **Display only the filter mask** — `Alt`/`Option`-click its thumbnail.
- **Filter stack editing** — reorder, hide, delete Smart Filters, and **Clear Smart Filters** (`LAY-021`).

### Properties-panel mask/property mode relationship

The panel is one dock with multiple pages (`PAN-006`). The mask relationship is:

| Selection | Properties-panel mode |
|---|---|
| Adjustment/fill layer content | Adjustment parameter page + Presets menu (`PAN-005`, `LAY-012`) |
| Layer mask thumbnail (or active mask) | Mask page: Density, Feather, Invert, Mask Edge, Color Range, Enable, Apply/Delete |
| Vector mask thumbnail | Vector-mask page: Reveal/Hide All, Delete (`LAY-005`) |
| Filter mask thumbnail | Filter-mask page: Density, Feather, Invert, Enable, Delete (**no Mask Edge**) |
| Smart Object layer | Proposed Smart Object page: source summary, Edit/Replace/Export, Rasterize, Stack Mode *(inferred)* |
| 3D element (Extended) | 3D page (`TOOL-061`) |
| Pixel/other layer | Layer content page or empty |

The **eye icon** toggles mask visibility, the **mask selector** chooses layer/vector/filter mask, and the **Apply/Delete** affordances act on the active mask. Selecting a different thumbnail in the Layers panel re-routes the page; no mask state persists in the panel itself.

## Algorithms & pipeline

This spec is a **surface/relationship layer**; the algorithms are owned elsewhere.

1. **Contextual routing.** The Properties panel derives a `PropertiesTarget` from the Layers/3D selection and binds the matching page (`PAN-006`). Mask targets are `LayerMask(id)`, `VectorMask(id)`, and `FilterMask(smart_filter_id)`.
2. **Mask evaluation.** Density/Feather/Invert are non-destructive parameters on the mask record, multiplied into the layer or filter contribution at composite time (`LAY-004`, `ARCH-006`). Filter masks gate the Smart Filter's output the same way (`LAY-021`).
3. **Mask Edge** invokes the shared Refine Edge pipeline (`SEL-003`); **Color Range** invokes `SEL-005`.
4. **Smart Object rendering.** The Smart Object renders its embedded source through the transform, then applies the Smart Filter stack (each filter optionally masked) (`LAY-020`, `LAY-021`).
5. **Smart Filter application.** Filters from the Filter menu that support smart application are pushed onto the stack as non-destructive entries rather than baked (`LAY-021`).
6. **Undo.** Each committed mask or Smart Filter change is the corresponding command (`ARCH-009`); live slider drags coalesce.

## Rust module mapping

The panel layer is thin; the model comes from the layer specs:

- `pictura_ui_bridge::PropertiesTarget` — extended with `FilterMask(SmartFilterId)` alongside the `PAN-006` variants.
- `pictura_ui_bridge::MaskController` — emits `SetMaskDensity` / `SetMaskFeather` / `SetMaskInvert` / `ApplyMask` / `DeleteMask` / `SetMaskEnabled` (`LAY-004`).
- `pictura_core::mask` — `RasterMask { density, feather, enabled, linked }`, `MaskKind::Filter` (`LAY-004`).
- `pictura_core::smart` — `SmartObject`, `SmartFilterStack` (`LAY-020`, `LAY-021`).
- `pictura_filter::smart` — Smart Filter evaluation + per-filter mask (`LAY-021`).
- `pictura_core::vector` / `path_ops` — vector-mask controls (`LAY-005`).

Crossing types: `NodeId`, `MaskRef`, `MaskKind`, `SmartFilterId`, `MaskParams`, `StackMode`. No Qt types cross into the core.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `PropertiesStack` | `QStackedWidget` | Pages (reused from `PAN-006`) |
| `MaskPropertiesWidget` | `QWidget` | Density, Feather, Invert, Mask Edge, Color Range, Enable, Apply/Delete |
| `VectorMaskPropertiesWidget` | `QWidget` | Reveal/Hide All, Delete (`LAY-005`) |
| `FilterMaskPropertiesWidget` | `QWidget` | Density, Feather, Invert, Enable, Delete; **no** Mask Edge |
| `SmartObjectPropertiesWidget` | `QWidget` | *(proposed)* Source summary, Edit/Replace/Export, Rasterize, Stack Mode |
| `SmartFilterStackModel` | `QAbstractItemModel` | Smart Filter rows + per-filter blend/opacity/mask (`LAY-021`) |
| `MaskThumbnailDelegate` | `QStyledItemDelegate` | Mask/filter-mask thumbnails, active border, red X, link icon (`PAN-001`) |
| `RefineMaskDialog` / `ColorRangeDialog` | `QDialog` | Reuse `SEL-003` / `SEL-005` dialogs |

Widgets over QML (dense docked controls, model/view; `ARCH-003`). The Layers panel owns the thumbnails/badges; the Properties panel owns the editors; both bind to the same Rust model, so no state is duplicated.

## Data-model impact

- **No second panel state.** The Masks panel has no persistent state to migrate; its settings were already `Node`/mask fields (`PAN-006`).
- **Mask records.** Layer/vector/filter mask parameters, enabled/invert flags, and density/feather round-trip per `LAY-004`/`LAY-005` (PSD mask-records, flag bit 4 for density/feather).
- **Smart Object/filter data.** The embedded source, transform, Smart Filter stack, filter-mask block (`FMsk`), and effects ids (`FXid`/`FEid`) round-trip per `LAY-020`/`LAY-021`; unknown descriptor fields are preserved opaquely.
- **Undo.** One command per committed mask/Smart Filter change (`ARCH-009`); apply/delete needs pixel backups; transform/reorder are non-destructive.
- **Edition gating.** Stack Mode is Extended-only; the proposed Smart Object Properties page must hide it in a Standard build (`OVR-002`).
- **Folder/collection gotcha.** The Help uses "Masks panel (CS6)" in a few procedures; this is a CS5 artifact — the model has no "Masks panel" object to serialize.

## Edge cases

- **Mask on a Smart Object layer** — Apply/Delete of the mask is refused; the control disables with a reason (`LAY-004`).
- **Filter mask + Mask Edge** — Mask Edge must be absent/disabled for filter masks (sourced).
- **Disabled mask/filter mask** — settings remain editable; the red X in the Layers panel communicates state.
- **No mask selected** — mask controls are hidden/disabled rather than acting on the layer; switching selection re-routes the page.
- **Both user and vector masks** — the panel must target the active one and not conflate them; the PSD `-3` channel rule applies (`LAY-004`).
- **Adjustment/fill layer auto-mask** — `Add Mask by Default` governs creation; toggling it is a panel-menu preference, not a document change.
- **32-bit masks** — Invert/Threshold enabled in CS6; density/feather remain meaningful.
- **CMYK/Lab/Gray** — masks are mode-independent; color operations use the working space.
- **Smart Filter on an unsupported mode/depth** — the filter row shows the warning icon (`LAY-021`); the filter-mask page still edits density/feather/invert.
- **Clear Smart Filters / delete filter** — removes the filter and its mask; undo must restore both.
- **Reorder Smart Filters** — filter masks travel with their filter (Help: masks can be moved/copied between effects).
- **Huge PSB** — mask edge/refine streams per tile; density/feather must not materialize the whole canvas.
- **GPU unavailable** — mask multiply and Smart Filter evaluation fall back to the CPU reference.
- **Undo/redo** — switching the Properties target flushes any in-progress live edit first (`PAN-006`).

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a layer mask thumbnail is selected, the Properties panel shows Density, Feather, Invert, Mask Edge, Color Range, Enable/Disable, and Apply/Delete; selecting the layer thumbnail returns to layer content.
2. Given Density `D` and Feather `F`, the mask's effective opacity/edge change without editing pixels, matching `LAY-004`.
3. Given a mask on a Smart Object layer, Apply/Delete is disabled with an explanation.
4. Given `Layer > Smart Filters` → filter mask selected, the panel shows Density/Feather/Invert/Enable/Delete and **no** Mask Edge.
5. Given a filter mask painted black/white/gray, the filter is hidden/revealed/partially visible; Alt/Option-clicking the thumbnail shows only the mask.
6. Given two Smart Filter Effects, dragging a filter mask onto the other moves it; Alt/Option-drag copies it.
7. Given a CS6 PSD with a user mask plus a vector mask, both affect the composite, both routes exist in the panel, and both round-trip.
8. Given a Smart Object (Extended), `Stack Mode` is offered; in a Standard build the page is absent and the scene round-trips unmodified.
9. Given an adjustment/fill layer with `Add Mask by Default` on, creating it also creates a layer mask; off, it does not.
10. Given `Refine Mask` from a layer mask, the `SEL-003` option set applies and Decontaminate Colors forces a new-layer/document output.

## Open questions

- **"Masks panel (CS6)" wording.** The fetched CS6 Help text says "Masks panel (CS6)" in the Apply/Delete procedure (line 9531) while elsewhere stating the CS5/CS6 split. This is treated as a CS5-era typo; confirm CS6 has no standalone Masks panel. *Resolves with:* a CS6 UI capture.
- **Is there a Smart Object Properties page in CS6?** `PAN-006` flags the full `PropertiesTarget` set as inferred; the fetched CS6 Help does not document a Smart Object page. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture of a selected Smart Object layer.
- **Where filter-mask controls live in CS6** — the Help describes them under "Masks panel", but CS6 retired it; likely the Properties panel's filter-mask mode. *Resolves with:* a CS6 UI capture.
- **Filter-mask Density/Feather defaults and ranges.** Not itemized. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture; coordinate with `LAY-021`.
- **Vector-mask page contents** in the Properties panel vs. the Paths panel are only partially sourced. *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture; `LAY-005`.
- **Does CS6 show the mask/filter-mask/blend/opacity editor inline in the Layers panel** or only in the Properties panel? *Resolves with:* a CS6 capture; `PAN-001`/`LAY-021`.
- **Threshold for 32-bit masks** — CS6 enables Invert and Threshold, but the panel placement and range of Threshold are not detailed in the fetched text. *Resolves with:* a CS6 32-bit capture.
