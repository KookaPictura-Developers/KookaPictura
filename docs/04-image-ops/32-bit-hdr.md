# 32-bit HDR Workflow

- **Spec ID:** `IMG-009`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 enables **Invert and Threshold adjustments for masks in 32-bit/channel images** and adds **new HDR Pro presets**; the Merge To HDR Pro command and 32-bit working mode themselves date from CS5.
- **Depends on:** `04-image-ops/bit-depth-and-conversion.md`, `04-image-ops/image-modes.md`, `04-image-ops/adjustments/exposure.md`, `04-image-ops/adjustments/hdr-toning.md`, `04-image-ops/adjustments/levels.md`, `04-image-ops/adjustments/hue-saturation.md`, `06-filters/blur-filters.md`, `01-architecture/file-formats.md` (`ARCH-011`), `01-architecture/color-management.md` (`ARCH-007`), `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md`, `09-automation/batch-processing.md`, `10-workflow-io/file-info-and-metadata.md`.

## CS6 behavior

### About HDR

- In Photoshop, the luminance of an HDR image is stored as **32-bit floating
  point per channel**. Values relate directly to scene light, unlike 8/16-bit
  files fixed to black→paper white.
- `File > Automate > Merge To HDR Pro` (also Bridge: `Tools > Photoshop > Merge
  To HDR Pro`) combines multiple exposures of the same scene into one HDR image.
- Because HDR exceeds a standard monitor's dynamic range, Photoshop provides a
  display preview; convert to 16/8-bit when a tool/filter does not support 32-bit.

### Merge To HDR Pro

1. `Browse` / `Add Open Files` / `Use > Folder` to choose source images; `Remove`
   removes one.
2. `Attempt To Automatically Align Source Images` (hand-held shots).
3. `OK`. If images lack exposure metadata, the **Manually Set EV** dialog
   appears.
4. The second dialog shows thumbnails, a merged preview, and a **bit depth**
   choice: `32 Bit` stores the entire dynamic range; 8/16-bit cannot.
5. Adjust tonal range (32-bit or 16/8-bit options, below).
6. `Preset > Save Preset` / `Load Preset`.
7. `Remove Ghosts` handles moving objects, outlining the base image in green.
8. **Response curves**: calculated automatically from the merged images; `Save
   Response Curve` / `Load Response Curve` via the dialog's response-curve menu.

### Options for 32-bit images

- A slider under the histogram adjusts the **white point preview only**; all HDR
  data remains in the file. The preview adjustment is **stored in the HDR file**
  (PSD, PSB, TIFF) and applied whenever the file is opened in Photoshop; readjust
  via `View > 32-Bit Preview Options`.

### Options for 16- or 8-bit tone mapping

Choose one tone-mapping method:

- **Local Adaptation** — adjusts local brightness regions.
  - `Edge Glow Radius` (size of local brightness regions) and `Strength` (tonal
    separation needed to split regions).
  - `Tone and Detail`: `Gamma` (1.0 maximises dynamic range; lower emphasises
    midtones, higher emphasises highlights/shadows), `Exposure` (in f-stops),
    `Detail` (sharpness), `Shadow`, `Highlight`.
  - `Color`: `Vibrance` (subtle colors, minimise clipping) and `Saturation`
    (−100 monochrome … +100 double).
  - `Toning Curve` — an adjustable curve over a histogram of the original 32-bit
    luminance; red ticks are 1 EV apart. By default the curve limits/equalises
    changes point-to-point; the `Corner` option removes the limit for more
    extreme, angular adjustments.
- **Equalize Histogram** — compresses dynamic range while preserving some
  contrast; automatic.
- **Exposure and Gamma** — manual: `Exposure` (gain) and `Gamma` (contrast).
- **Highlight Compression** — compresses highlights into the 8/16-bit
  luminance range; automatic.

### Adjust displayed dynamic range

- `View > 32-Bit Preview Options` → Method `Exposure And Gamma` (sliders) or
  `Highlight Compression`.
- Document **status bar** `32-Bit Exposure` slider sets a per-view white point;
  double-click resets; per-view settings are **not** stored in the file.
- Info panel can show **32-Bit** readouts (Eyedropper icon → 32-Bit).

### HDR Color Picker

- Regular picker plus an **Intensity** slider (brightness), 32-bit RGB floating
  fields, a Preview area of swatches at different exposures, `Preview Stop Size`,
  `Relative to Document`, and `Add to Swatches`. Intensity stops correspond
  inversely to exposure stops.

### Painting/editing support

- Editable with Brush, Pencil, Pen, Shape, Clone Stamp, Pattern Stamp, Eraser,
  Gradient, Blur, Sharpen, Smudge, History Brush, and the Text tool.

## Algorithms & pipeline

- **Merge.** Camera response curve recovery + radiance merge. The canonical
  formulations are **Debevec & Malik (1997)** (estimate inverse CRF via a
  smoothness-regularised least-squares solve, then a weighted average of
  linearised exposures) and **Robertson (1999)** (iterative CRF estimate).
  Photoshop's response curve is "automatically calculated" and `Save/Load
  Response Curve` exchanges it. **Behavioural parity only, algorithm TBD**;
  the industry-standard methods are the modelling reference.
- **Alignment.** Automatic alignment of hand-held brackets (feature/translation
  based); exact Adobe method closed.
- **Ghost removal.** Choose a base exposure (best tonal balance, green outline)
  and take moving-object pixels from it.
- **Tone mapping.** Global operators: `Exposure and Gamma` (gain/contrast),
  `Highlight Compression`, `Equalize Histogram` (histogram equalisation). Local
  operator: `Local Adaptation` (edge-aware local brightness regions plus the
  Toning Curve). Adobe's Local Adaptation is closed; published analogous local
  operators include Reinhard, Drago, and Mantiuk. **Behavioural parity only,
  algorithm TBD.**
- **Display preview.** A separate exposure/gamma (or highlight-compression)
  transform maps HDR to the monitor; stored (32-bit options) or per-view (status
  bar). Never edits pixel data.
- **Feature gating** follows the matrix above; unsupported commands are disabled
  in 32-bpc documents.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed:

- `pictura-core::hdr` — `HdrImage` (planar/interleaved `f32`), `merge_hdr(inputs: &[Exposure], opts: MergeOptions) -> HdrImage`.
- `MergeOptions { align: bool, remove_ghosts: bool, response: Option<ResponseCurve>, ev: Option<Vec<f32>> }`.
- `ResponseCurve` — per-channel lookup, loadable/savable.
- `ToneMapOperator { LocalAdaptation(LocalAdaptationParams), EqualizeHistogram, ExposureGamma { exposure, gamma }, HighlightCompression }`.
- `PreviewOptions { method, exposure, gamma }`.
- `pictura-core::document::HdrPreview` — white-point preview stored in the
  document (PSD/PSB/TIFF).
- `pictura-core::color::hdr_picker` — 32-bit float color selection.
- Reuse `adjust::hue_saturation`, `adjust::levels`, `05-layers/blend-modes` for
  the supported subset.

## Qt6 component mapping

- `MergeToHdrProDialog` (`QDialog`) — file list + Browse/Add/Folder, Align,
  Remove Ghosts, bit-depth combo, tone-mapping params (stacked pages per method),
  response-curve menu, preset menu.
- `ManuallySetEvDialog` — per-image EV entry.
- `HdrPreviewOptionsDialog`, `HdrColorPicker` (with Preview swatches),
  `HdrStatusBarExposure` widget.
- `ToneMappingPanel` — Local Adaptation sliders + `ToningCurveWidget` (shared
  with Curves).
- All HDR preview/compute runs on the GPU where available (`QRhi`/`wgpu`);
  a CPU fallback must exist (`ARCH-010`).

## Data-model impact

- `DocumentBitDepth = 32` with `f32` pixel buffers; the model must not clamp
  intermediates.
- The 32-bit **preview white point** is stored in PSD/PSB/TIFF. PSD resource
  **1070** (`HDR Toning information`, Photoshop CS2) exists for HDR toning data;
  whether CS6 uses it for the preview is unverified.
- `Image > Mode > 16/8 Bits/Channel` is a destructive command; undo stores a
  pre-image (or the tone-map parameters plus pre-image), per `ARCH-009`.
- Merge To HDR Pro may run as an `09-automation` merge job; it reads exposure
  metadata (EXIF) from each source (`10-workflow-io/file-info-and-metadata.md`).
- `Save/Load Preset` and `Save/Load Response Curve` are separate files, not
  document state.

## Edge cases

- **Missing exposure metadata** → Manually Set EV dialog.
- **Moving objects** → Remove Ghosts; very light/dark movement may need a
  different base thumbnail.
- **Alignment failures** on large motion.
- **Monitor cannot display HDR** → preview only; never modifies data.
- **GPU unavailable** → CPU preview/tone-map fallback; 32-bit features that
  depend on MGE must degrade explicitly.
- **Unsupported tools/filters/adjustments** in 32-bpc are disabled; convert to
  16/8-bit (destructive) to access them.
- **LogLuv TIFF** is read-only.
- **Huge HDR / PSB**: merge and tone-map by tile; avoid multiple full float
  buffers.
- **Saving to formats that cannot hold 32-bit float** (PNG/JPEG) must go through
  an 8/16-bit conversion first — warn on data loss.
- **Color management**: HDR radiance is scene-referred; conversion to output
  spaces must not clamp.
- **Layer edits in 32-bit**: only the supported adjustment/blend set applies.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given three EV-bracketed exposures of the same scene, Merge To HDR Pro at
   32 Bit produces a float image whose radiance is monotonic across the bracket
   and matches a Debevec reference within the tolerance in
   `11-cross-cutting/testing-strategy.md`.
2. Given a saved response curve, reusing it on the same inputs reproduces the
   first merge within tolerance.
3. Given `Remove Ghosts` on with a known moving object, the object is taken from
   the base exposure (green-outlined) and ghosting is absent.
4. Given a 32-bit image, every command in the availability matrix is enabled and
   every excluded command is disabled.
5. Given a 32→16-bit conversion with Exposure and Gamma, output luminance equals
   `clip(exposure * 2^EV)^(1/gamma)` within tolerance; Highlight Compression
   maps values above the LDR white to white without hard clipping of midtones.
6. Given `View > 32-Bit Preview Options`, changing Method/Exposure/Gamma changes
   only the preview; the stored `f32` pixels are byte-identical before and after.
7. Given the status-bar 32-Bit Exposure slider, the adjustment is per-view and
   is not written to the file (reopening restores the stored preview).
8. Given a 32-bit PSD saved and reopened, the preview white point is restored.
9. Given CS6, Invert and Threshold adjustments work on masks in 32-bit/channel
   documents (the CS6 change).
10. Given a 32-bit image saved as TIFF, values round-trip without clamping
    within float tolerance.
