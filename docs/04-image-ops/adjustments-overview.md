# Adjustments — Overview

- **Spec ID:** `ADJ-000`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — the adjustment *engine* is unchanged, but the host UI moves: CS5 kept controls and presets inside the Adjustments panel, CS6 adds the new **Properties panel** (controls + a Preset menu), leaving the Adjustments panel as icon buttons only. CS6 also adds the **Color Lookup** adjustment and improves the Levels/Curves/Brightness-Contrast **Auto** button.
- **Depends on:** `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-008`), `01-architecture/undo-history.md` (`ARCH-009`), `01-architecture/color-management.md` (`ARCH-007`), `04-image-ops/image-modes.md` (`IMG-004`), `04-image-ops/bit-depth-and-conversion.md` (`IMG-005`), `05-layers/adjustment-layers.md`, `05-layers/blend-modes.md`, `05-layers/layer-masks.md`, `05-layers/vector-masks-and-clipping-masks.md`, `02-ui-ux/panels/adjustments-panel.md`, `02-ui-ux/panels/properties-panel.md`.

## CS6 behavior

Photoshop CS6 exposes color and tonal correction in two forms with identical
math but different lifetimes:

1. **Destructive commands** under `Image > Adjustments > …`. They rewrite the
   pixels of the **active layer** in place and **discard image information**
   (CS6 Help, repeated in every adjustment section). No mask, no re-edit.
2. **Adjustment layers** created from the **Adjustments panel** or
   `Layer > New Adjustment Layer > …`. They store the adjustment parameters, not
   pixels, and "apply to all the layers below [them]"; they carry a layer mask
   by default and "have the same opacity and blending mode options as image
   layers." They can be clipped to the layer directly below, grouped, hidden,
   reordered, duplicated, and copied between documents. This is the recommended,
   non-destructive path.

The CS6 Help states the general model: "All Photoshop color adjustment tools work
essentially the same way; they map an existing range of pixel values to a new
range of values. The difference between the tools is the amount of control they
provide." Accessing a color/tone command in the Adjustments panel "automatically
creates an adjustment layer."

### The adjustment taxonomy (CS6)

Two command families feed the same panel:

- **Tonal adjustments** — Levels, Curves, Brightness/Contrast, Exposure,
  Shadow/Highlight (`Image > Adjustments` only), HDR Toning, Auto Tone/Contrast/
  Color, Equalize.
- **Color adjustments** — Hue/Saturation, Vibrance, Color Balance, Black & White,
  Photo Filter, Channel Mixer, Selective Color, Color Lookup (CS6), Gradient Map,
  Invert, Posterize, Threshold, Desaturate, Match Color, Replace Color.

Availability split (CS6):

| Command | Adjustment layer | Destructive `Image > Adjustments` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Levels | Yes | Yes | PSD key `levl` |
| Curves | Yes | Yes | PSD key `curv` |
| Brightness/Contrast | Yes | Yes | PSD key `brit` |
| Exposure | Yes (8/16; 32-bit Extended only) | Yes | PSD key `expA` |
| Vibrance | Yes | Yes | PSD key `vibA` |
| Hue/Saturation | Yes | Yes | PSD keys `hue ` / `hue2` |
| Color Balance | Yes | Yes | PSD key `blnc` |
| Black & White | Yes | Yes | PSD key `blwh` |
| Photo Filter | Yes | Yes | PSD key `phfl` |
| Channel Mixer | Yes | Yes | PSD key `mixr` |
| Color Lookup (CS6) | Yes | Yes | new in CS6 |
| Selective Color | Yes | Yes | PSD key `selc` |
| Gradient Map | Yes | Yes | PSD key `grdm` |
| Invert | Yes | Yes | PSD key `nvrt` |
| Posterize | Yes | Yes | PSD key `post` |
| Threshold | Yes | Yes | PSD key `thrs` |
| Shadow/Highlight | **No** | Yes | never an adjustment layer (community + Help line "applies adjustments directly … will discard image information") |
| HDR Toning | **No** | Yes | requires flattened layers |
| Desaturate | **No** | Yes | command only |
| Auto Tone / Auto Contrast / Auto Color | (via Levels/Curves Auto) | Yes | also drive the Auto button |
| Equalize | **No** | Yes | command only |
| Match Color | **No** | Yes | command only |
| Replace Color | **No** | Yes | command only |
| Fill layers (Solid Color / Gradient / Pattern) | Yes (fill layer) | — | "unlike adjustment layers, fill layers do not affect the layers underneath" |

The PSD adjustment keys above are the canonical serialization of adjustment-layer
parameters (`ARCH-008`); each stores "the same data as that adjustment's load
file."

### Adjustment layer mechanics

- **Mask** — every adjustment/fill layer gets a layer mask by default unless
  `Add Mask by Default` is deselected in the panel menu. A pixel selection at
  creation masks the unselected area black; a closed path at creation produces a
  **vector mask** instead. Painting gray on the mask varies the effect. The Help:
  "Using the Brush tool, you can paint black areas on the mask where you don't
  want the adjustment to affect the image."
- **Clipping** — the `Clip to Layer` button ("Clip to Layer button … Click the
  icon again to make the adjustment apply to all layers below it") confines the
  adjustment to the layer immediately below. In the Layers panel this is the
  clipping-mask relationship (base/non-base byte in the PSD layer record).
- **Blend mode / opacity / fill opacity** — adjustment layers carry the full
  layer property set; the result is composited with the document's 27 blend
  modes. Blend math is behavioral parity per the PDF blend specification
  (`05-layers/blend-modes.md`).
- **Grouping** — to confine an adjustment to a fixed set of layers, put those
  layers in a group and change the group's mode from `Pass Through` to any other
  mode, then place the adjustment on top of the group.
- **Merge / rasterize** — merging an adjustment layer into the layer below
  "rasterize[s the adjustments] and become[s] permanently applied within the
  merged layer." Adjustment layers with all-white masks add negligible file size.
- **Properties** — `Layer > Layer Content Options`, or double-clicking the layer
  thumbnail, reopens the settings; the Help notes "Inverted adjustment layers do
  not have editable settings" (i.e. an inverted/mask-only layer).

### CS6 changes (the "adjustment presets" change)

CS5 vs CS6 panel behavior, verbatim:

- "In CS5, the Adjustments panel has a list of adjustment presets that apply
  common image corrections. In CS6, the Properties panel has a Presets menu with
  the adjustment presets."
- 
- Presets can be **saved** for **Levels, Curves, Exposure, Hue/Saturation, Black &
  White, Channel Mixer, and Selective Color**; a saved preset is appended to the
  list. `Load Preset` also appears in the adjustment dialogs.
- The What's New section lists "improved Auto options for the Levels, Curves, and
  Brightness/Contrast adjustments"; Alt/Option-clicking the Auto button opens the
  Auto Color Correction Options dialog.
- The CS6 JDI (productivity) list adds: "Sample size options now appear in context
  menu for various Eyedropper tools (black point and white point in Levels, and so
  forth)."
- CS6 adds the **Color Lookup** adjustment layer (community sources) and the
  **HDR Toning** command.

## Algorithms & pipeline

### The shared point-operation model

Every tonal/color adjustment in this family is a **pointwise map** on channel
samples (optionally after a color-space transform):

```text
out(x,y,c) = f_c( in(x,y,c) )        for a per-channel map (Levels, Curves)
out(x,y)   = g( in(x,y,·) )          for a vector map (Vibrance, Hue/Sat)
```

Two implementations are equivalent within the tolerance:

1. **Direct evaluation** per pixel (keeps full 32-bit float precision).
2. **Lookup table (LUT)** — build a 1-D LUT of N entries for per-channel maps
   (N = 256 / 4096 / 65536 by bit depth) or a 3-D LUT for vector maps, then
   sample. The Adobe pipeline is LUT-based in practice; a LUT makes the
   GPU path trivial and is exact when N ≥ the sample range. 8/16-bit documents
   are exact; 32-bit float documents must use direct evaluation or a large LUT
   with interpolation (LUT interpolation is an approximation — mark it).

The document bit depth sets the scalar type: `u8` (8 bpc), `u16` (16 bpc),
`f32` (32 bpc HDR). All normalized math below uses `v ∈ [0,1]` for integer
depths and unbounded/`[0,∞)` linear values for 32-bit (see `IMG-005`).

### Where the adjustment sits in the pipeline

An adjustment layer is a node in the layer stack. Compositing walks bottom-to-top
(`ARCH-008`):

1. The backdrop (all layers below the adjustment) is composited.
2. If clipped, the backdrop is the clip base only.
3. The adjustment transforms its **input** — for a normal adjustment layer, the
   accumulated composite below; for a smart filter-like behaviour or a
   destructive command, the target layer's own pixels.
4. The transformed result is masked (`mask × vector_mask`), scaled by opacity,
   and blended into the backdrop with the layer's blend mode.

Adjustment layers therefore always read the **composited** colors, not their own
pixel buffer (they have none). Destructive commands read and write the target
layer's pixels directly.

### Color mode and per-channel semantics

- **RGB** — three channels + composite ("RGB") channel. Per-channel edits index
  R/G/B; the composite edit applies the same map to all three.
- **CMYK** — four channels + composite; Curves shows **ink percentages** rather
  than light values and the graph is oriented so 0% ink is at the lower-left.
- **Lab** — L/a/b; Curves shows **light values**.
- **Grayscale** — single channel; composite only (per-channel menus collapse).
- **Alpha / spot channels** — in Levels the Help says "Edit spot channels and
  alpha channels individually"; composite multi-channel selection is available in
  the destructive command (Shift-select channels in the Channels panel) but not
  in a Levels adjustment layer.
- **Bitmap / Indexed** — per-pixel color adjustments are not meaningful; the
  commands are unavailable (verify per command).

### Auto corrections (shared by Levels and Curves)

The `Auto` button and the Auto Tone/Contrast/Color commands share the **Auto
Color Correction Options** model (see `ADJ-001` for the full control list). The
three documented algorithms:

- **Enhance Monochromatic Contrast** — "Clips all channels identically …
  preserves the overall color relationship"; used by `Auto Contrast`.
- **Enhance Per Channel Contrast** — "Maximizes the tonal range in each channel";
  may add/remove color casts; used by `Auto Tone`.
- **Find Dark & Light Colors** — finds average lightest/darkest pixels to
  maximize contrast with minimal clipping; used by `Auto Color`; combined with
  **Snap Neutral Midtones** to neutralize a cast.

Exact black/white-point statistics and the midtone-neutralization math are closed
by Adobe; parity is behavioral.

### Bit-depth availability (CS6 documented)

The CS6 32-bpc feature list names the adjustments available at 32 bpc:
**Levels, Exposure, Hue/Saturation, Channel Mixer, Photo Filter** (and, in the
Layers-command list, also **Vibrance**). **Curves** and **Brightness/Contrast**
are absent from the list and are therefore unavailable at 32 bpc *(documented by
absence; confirm — see Open questions)*. Adjustment layers for 32-bit images are
available "in Photoshop Extended only."

## Rust module mapping

Design proposal.

- `pictura-core::adjust` — `Adjustment` enum (`Levels | Curves | BrightnessContrast
  | Exposure | Vibrance | …`), parameter structs, and `AdjustmentLayer { params,
  blend, opacity, mask }`. Serialization keys mirror the PSD keys (`levl`, `curv`,
  `brit`, `expA`, `vibA`, …).
- `pictura-image::adjust::lut` — `ToneLut { entries: usize, scalar: Scalar }` with
  `build_u8`, `build_u16`, `build_f32`, and `sample_f32`. Shared by every
  per-channel adjustment.
- `pictura-image::adjust::ops` — `apply_lut`, `apply_vector`, `apply_log_lut`
  (RGB/CMYK/Lab/Gray dispatch), tile-parallel with rayon.
- `pictura-render::adjust` — wgpu compute / fragment variants that sample a 1-D
  LUT texture or a 3-D LUT; CPU path is the reference.
- `pictura-core::adjust::auto` — `AutoCorrection { algorithm, clip_shadows,
  clip_highlights, target_shadow, target_midtone, target_highlight,
  snap_neutral_midtones }` and the statistics gatherer.
- Boundary types: `Scalar`, `ChannelSet`, `Rect`, `TileRef`, `MaskRef`,
  `BlendMode`. Pixel buffers are planar per channel, matching `ARCH-008`.

## Qt6 component mapping

Design proposal (Widgets; QML only for the curve editor if a canvas is easier).

- `AdjustmentsPanel` (`QWidget`) — the icon grid; each click emits
  `createAdjustmentLayer(kind)`.
- `PropertiesPanel` (`QStackedWidget`) — hosts one properties widget per
  adjustment plus the Masks controls (density/feather, Color Range, Invert).
- `AdjustmentPresetMenu` (`QMenu`) — lists built-ins + saved presets; backed by a
  `PresetModel` persisted to disk.
- `AutoCorrectionDialog` (`QDialog`) — the shared Auto Color Correction Options.
- `AdjustmentLayerModel` / `LayersModel` (`QAbstractItemModel`) — exposes kind,
  params, mask, blend, opacity, clipping.
- Reusable widgets: `ToneCurveEditor` (Curves, and the Levels output/gamma mini
  controls), `LevelsHistogramWidget`, `ScrubSpinBox` for numeric fields.

The panel split (icons in Adjustments, controls in Properties) mirrors CS6; a
single combined panel is a deliberate divergence and must be a settings option,
not the default, to preserve CS6 muscle memory.

## Data-model impact

- A new node kind `NodeKind::Adjustment { params, mask }` exists in the document
  arena (`ARCH-008`); its parameters are typed, not opaque.
- PSD serialization: adjustment parameters go in the documented adjustment keys
  (`levl`, `curv`, `brit`, `expA`, `vibA`, …); unknown keys are preserved
  verbatim. Mask uses channel IDs `-2` (user) / `-3` (real user when both masks
  exist). Clipping and blend keys use the layer-record fields.
- Undo: editing an adjustment parameter is a **scalar command** with a small
  record (before/after parameter blob); committing a destructive `Image >
  Adjustments` edit is a **pixel command** retaining the pre-edit tiles. Live
  drag inside the Properties panel coalesces into a single history state on
  release/commit, matching Photoshop.
- Adjustment layers with all-white masks add negligible file size; do not force
  a rasterization on save.
- 32-bit: the parameter structs must be depth-agnostic (store normalized floats),
  so the same adjustment round-trips at 8/16/32.

## Edge cases

- **No layer / background layer** — destructive commands apply to the background
  and permanently alter it; adjustment layers always need at least one layer
  below (an adjustment on the bottom is a no-op).
- **Bitmap / Indexed / Multichannel** — many adjustments are unavailable; the
  command must be dimmed rather than silently converting the mode.
- **Grayscale** — per-channel menus collapse; Vibrance/Saturation have no
  meaningful chroma and should be disabled or inert (mark).
- **32-bit** — Curves/Brightness-Contrast unavailable; Exposure native; integer
  LUTs invalid on float data.
- **Empty / 1-px documents** — LUT still builds; apply is a no-op over zero
  pixels; no panic.
- **Huge (PSB) documents** — build the LUT once and apply per tile; never
  materialize a full-canvas float copy.
- **GPU unavailable** — CPU reference produces the same result within the
  tolerance; the LUT makes CPU↔GPU equality attainable for 8/16-bit.
- **Clipping mask with no base** — clipped adjustment whose base is hidden yields
  no effect; document explicitly.
- **Undo mid-drag** — interactive edits are coalesced; released edits are atomic.
- **Adjustment above a group** — respects the group's `Pass Through` vs isolated
  mode (`ARCH-008`).
- **Inverted / empty mask** — "inverted adjustment layers do not have editable
  settings" in CS6; represent as mask-only.
- **Mode conversion later** — converting RGB→CMYK reinterprets adjustment
  parameters (Curves becomes ink percentages); parameter migration is a
  documented open question.
- **Memory** — an adjustment layer costs parameters + mask only, not a pixel
  buffer.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given an RGB document, `Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Levels` creates a layer
   that changes the composite of the layers below but leaves their pixels
   unchanged; deleting the layer restores the original appearance exactly.
2. Given an active selection, creating an adjustment layer produces a mask that
   is black in the unselected area and white in the selection.
3. Given `Clip to Layer`, the adjustment affects only the immediate base layer;
   toggling the clip button restores effect on all layers below.
4. Given a saved preset for each of Levels/Curves/Exposure/Hue-Sat/B&W/Channel
   Mixer/Selective Color, the preset persists across restart and re-applies the
   same parameter values.
5. Given an `Image > Adjustments > Levels` edit, exactly one history state is
   added and `Ctrl+Z` restores the pre-edit pixels bit-exactly.
6. Given a 32-bpc document, the Curves and Brightness/Contrast entries are
   unavailable, while Levels and Exposure are available.
7. Given a Bitmap document, per-pixel color adjustments are dimmed.
8. Given a 1×1 document and any adjustment, the operation completes without
   panic and produces a deterministic result.
9. Given a group set to `Pass Through` containing an adjustment, moving the
   adjustment above/below the group changes the composite per the documented
   pass-through semantics.
10. Given an adjustment layer with a mask painted gray, the effect is
    proportional to the mask value at each pixel within the tolerance of the
    testing strategy.
