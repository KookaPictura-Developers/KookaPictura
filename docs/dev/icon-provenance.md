# Icon provenance and rename map

Generated from `assets/icons/lucide-map.json` by the vendoring tool. Do
not edit by hand; change the JSON and regenerate.

## Upstream

- **Lucide** 1.50.0 — https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide
- Icons: `https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/v1.50.0/icons`
- License: **ISC**, with a subset derived from Feather under **MIT**;
  full text in `LICENSES/Lucide.txt`.
- Style contract: `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, `fill="none"`,
  `stroke="currentColor"`, `stroke-width="2"`, round caps/joins.
  Colour is applied at render time (the loader tints by alpha), so the
  vendored files carry no baked colour. Internal shading uses alpha
  gradients / `stroke-opacity`.

## Summary (165 icons)

- Lucide-derived: **91**
- Custom (Lucide-style): **61**
- Note / deferred: **3**
- Out of scope (3D tools, file unchanged): **10**

## Rename map

`source` is `lucide:<slug>` for vendored icons, `custom` for
hand-authored assets, or the note for deferred entries.
