# STATE — project resume anchor

Snapshot for resuming after a context break. Update after each milestone.

## Where things are

- Repo: `github.com/Zawaro/kooka-pictura`, branch `main`. Docs-only corpus +
  a working Rust/Qt engine.
- Toolchain: Rust 1.98 (`rust-toolchain.toml`), system Qt **6.11.1**, cxx-qt
  **0.10.0**, wgpu **30.0.1**, lcms2 **6.2.0** (system Little CMS 2.19).
- Oracles installed for tests: `psd-tools` 1.19, ImageMagick 7.1.2, `magick`.
- Test suite: **379 tests, 1 ignored** (one pre-existing app `#[ignore]`).
- OpenSpec **1.3.1** (`/usr/bin/openspec`). M0–M10 archived; canonical specs are
  in `openspec/specs/` (29 capabilities, 207 requirements, `validate --all --strict`
  green), change history under `openspec/changes/archive/`.

| `pictura-adjust` | 15 destructive adjustments (`apply`) |
| `pictura-filters` | blur/sharpen/noise + stylize/other + pixelate + distort filters (`Filter` + `apply`); seeded filters |
| `pictura-select` | selection coverage mask, boolean/modify ops, wand, color range |
| `pictura-ops` | image resize (Nearest/Bilinear/Bicubic), canvas size (9 anchors), rotate/flip + arbitrary rotation; ImageMagick oracle |
| `pictura-render` | CPU compositor (27 blend modes, groups, masks, adjustment layers) + GPU compositor + PSD adjustment encode/decode + `apply_filter` (layer filter gated by mask) + `document_ops` (document resize/canvas/orientation) |
| `pictura-testkit` | golden compare/hash + `pictura-diff` CLI |

## Milestones done

- **M0/M0.5** — cxx-qt↔Qt6 walking skeleton, PSD codec, harness, CI, GPU spike.
  GPU: offscreen wgpu→readback→QImage works; QRhi imports the wgpu VkDevice/image;
  on-screen present via `QRhiWidget` is blocked (`crates/pictura-app/GPU-INTEROP-NOTES.md`).
- **M1** — layer/channel/mask model + layered PSD round-trip (+psd-tools oracle).
- **M2/M2.5** — CPU compositor (27 modes) + ImageMagick oracle; GPU compositor
  (22 modes, Δ0); app renders the layer stack.
- **M3** — ICC color management (+ ImageMagick oracle).
- **M4 (A/B/C)** — 15 adjustments; adjustment layers (decoded: `nvrt`,`post`,
  `thrs`,`brit`,`levl`,`hue2`; others preserved-only); app adjustment UI.
- **M5 (A/B/C)** — selection math (+ IM morphology oracle); selection↔PSD
  channels; selection-masked adjustments in the app.
- **M6** — `pictura-filters`: blur (Gaussian/Box/Motion/Radial/Average/
  Blur(+More)/Surface), sharpen (Sharpen(+More)/Edges/Unsharp Mask), noise
  (Add Noise seeded/Median/Despeckle). ImageMagick oracle: Gaussian/Box/Median
  exact, USM ±6; Motion classified no-equivalent (IM kernel is one-sided). 47
  filter tests. OpenSpec change `m6-filters`, tasks checked.
- **M6-C** — filter integration: `pictura-render::apply_filter(layer, filter,
  mask)` (destructive, selection/mask-confined, alpha + layer meta preserved) and
  the app `apply_filter(kind)` command + dock control. Headless self-test proves
  confinement (`changed_inside=12 changed_outside=0`). OpenSpec change
  `m6-filter-integration`, tasks checked.
- **M7** — Stylize + Other filters: `Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Offset`, `High Pass`,
  `Custom` (Other); `Emboss`, `Find Edges`, `Solarize` (Stylize). ImageMagick
  oracle exact (Δ0) for Maximum/Minimum/Offset-wrap/Custom/Solarize; Emboss,
  Find Edges, High Pass, Offset-fill classified no-equivalent. App filter kinds
  added. OpenSpec change `m7-stylize-other`, tasks checked.
- **M8** — Pixelate filters: `Mosaic`, `Crystallize`, `Facet`, `Fragment`,
  `Mezzotint`, `Pointillize`, `Color Halftone`. Oracle: Mosaic exact (block
  average when the cell divides the dimensions); the other six no-equivalent
  with recorded deltas; seeded filters reproducible. App filter kinds added.
  OpenSpec change `m8-pixelate`, tasks checked.
- **M9** — Distort warps: `Twirl`, `Pinch`, `Spherize`, `Ripple`, `Wave`
  (single-image inverse-mapping with bilinear resampling; alpha untouched; Wave
  seeded, `repeat_edge` selectable). All five classified no-equivalent against
  the closest ImageMagick operator (Twirl closest at Δ124 vs `-swirl 45`);
  measured deltas recorded. App filter kinds added. OpenSpec change
  `m9-distort`, tasks checked.
- **M10** — `pictura-ops` image operations: `resize` (Nearest/Bilinear/Bicubic),
  `resize_canvas` (9 anchors, grow/shrink), orientation (`rotate90_cw/ccw`,
  `rotate180`, flips, `rotate_arbitrary`). ImageMagick oracle: Nearest and the
  exact right-angle rotations/flips and 3-channel canvas are exact (Δ0); Bicubic
  matches `-filter catrom` (tol 1; `cubic` is a B-spline); Bilinear is exact on
  upscale but no-equivalent downscale; `rotate_arbitrary` measured on the central
  region (max 8 at 30°, 45° no-equivalent). OpenSpec change `m10-image-ops`,
  tasks checked; app/document integration deferred.
- **M11** — Distort filters, part 2: `PolarCoordinates`, `Shear`, `ZigZag`,
  `OceanRipple` (inverse-mapping warps with bilinear resampling; alpha
  untouched; Shear `fill` selectable, Ocean Ripple seeded). All nine Distort
  filters are now implemented, and all four new ones are classified
  **no-equivalent** against their closest ImageMagick operators with measured
  deltas (Polar Δ189/58 and 194/59 vs `-distort Polar`/`DePolar`; Shear Δ255/18
  vs `-shear`; ZigZag Δ170/14 vs `-swirl`; Ocean Ripple Δ227/54 vs `-wave`).
  Shear's curve range check (`x`/`y` in `-1..=1`) added. App filter kinds added.
  OpenSpec change `m11-distort2` MODIFIED the canonical `distort-filters` spec
  (7 MODIFIED + 4 ADDED); tasks checked.
- **M12** — Document operations: document-level resize/canvas/rotate/flip in
  `pictura-render`; reuses `pictura-ops`; structural oracle via psd-tools +
  composite consistency + exactness identities; app integration deferred.
  OpenSpec change `m12-document-ops`, tasks checked.

## Spec workflow (OpenSpec)

OpenSpec is the per-change requirements layer over `docs/`. See `AGENTS.md`
"Spec workflow (OpenSpec)". M0–M10 are archived; `openspec/specs/` is now the
canonical contract, with the per-change history under
`openspec/changes/archive/`. New work starts as a new change under
`openspec/changes/` (not as code), with `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`,
and `specs/<capability>/spec.md` deltas, archived into `openspec/specs/` when
complete.

## Conventions (keep doing)

- Task briefs live in `docs/dev/m*-*.md`; docs changes need a commit message
  containing `TASK-ALLOWS-DOCS` or `TASK_ALLOWS_DOCS=1` for `guard.sh`.
- Each milestone: freeze interfaces → dispatch 2–3 `general` sub-agents on
  **disjoint crates** → orchestrator integrates, un-ignores oracle tests,
  verifies, commits. Never let an implementer verify its own work without an
  independent oracle (psd-tools / ImageMagick).
- Oracles: don't fake tolerances. Where ImageMagick/Photoshop semantics diverge,
  reclassify as "no faithful equivalent" and use property/known-value tests.

## Next: M13 (propose via OpenSpec first)

M11 (Distort part 2) and M12 (document operations) are implemented and validated
but **unarchived** until `openspec archive m11-distort2` and `openspec archive
m12-document-ops` merge their deltas into `openspec/specs/`. Candidate next
areas: app/document UI integration for image ops, undo/history, image
modes/bit-depth, the remaining filter families (Render, Liquify, Blur Gallery,
Camera Raw), or a different spec area (`docs/07-color-painting`,
`docs/03-tools`, `docs/09-automation`).

Process: every new milestone is proposed through OpenSpec first
(`openspec/changes/<name>`, new capabilities), validated, then implemented.
M6/M6-C/M7/M8/M9/M10 are archived; their deltas now live in
`openspec/specs/`.

## Known risks / open items

- Core API is frozen only where noted; adding fields breaks struct literals.
- PSD descriptor coverage is partial (adjustment layers, layer styles not yet).
- GPU is non-authoritative; non-separable blend modes and Dissolve are CPU-only.
- `pictura-app` has one `#[ignore]`d interop test.
