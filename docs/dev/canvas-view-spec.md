# Canvas & View Behaviour Spec

- **Status:** dev note (not a milestone proposal)
- **Scope:** how the document canvas/view should behave, the Move-tool drag
  contract, and the interactive performance budget. Written against the
  implementation at `crates/pictura-app` (ImageView, ToolController, frame) and
  `PictureView` (cxxqt_object.rs).
- **Companion specs:** `03-tools/hand-and-zoom.md` (TOOL-042),
  `03-tools/move-and-transform.md` (TOOL-001),
  `02-ui-ux/panels/navigator-panel.md` (PAN-014),
  `02-ui-ux/application-frame.md` (UI-001),
  `01-architecture/performance-targets.md` (ARCH-013),
  `01-architecture/gpu-rendering-pipeline.md` (ARCH-006).

Facts below are marked **CS6** (stated in the archived CS6 Help PDF or a
first-party Adobe page), **CS6-sec** (secondary/community but consistent), or
**[ext]** (a Kooka Pictura extension that CS6 does *not* do by default).

---

## 1. Intended canvas behaviour

### 1.1 Initial view on open/new

- **CS6-sec:** an image opens **Fit-to-Screen** when it is larger than the
  window, and centred; a document that already fits opens at 100%. Adobe
  support and current-product docs describe Fit-on-Screen as the default open
  view, and users ask how to *disable* it, which confirms it is the default.
  The CS6 Help PDF documents `View > Fit On Screen` and `100%` but does **not**
  print the open default, so the "fit when larger" rule is secondary-confirmed,
  not PDF-confirmed.
- **CS6:** zoom and scroll are **view state**, not document content; they are
  not history states and must not appear in the History panel.
- **Current code:** `ImageView::setImage` resets `zoom_ = 1.0` and
  `offset_ = QPointF()` (`image_view.cpp:24`). `(0,0)` is the **top-left**, not
  centre, so a document opens pinned top-left at 100%. `Frame::addDocument`
  calls `setImage` (`frame.cpp:251`), and `fitOnScreen`/`actualPixels` are never
  called on open.
- **Required:** after a document is loaded, set the view to fit-and-centre when
  the document exceeds the viewport, else 100% centred. Reuse
  `ImageView::fitOnScreen` (it already computes `min(w/doc_w, h/doc_h) * 0.95`
  and centres) rather than reimplementing the math. `setImage` should centre
  even in the 100% case (its own doc comment already claims "centred"; the code
  contradicts it).
- **Scroll bars / overscroll** are part of CS6 Standard Screen Mode (UI-001);
  out of scope for this note beyond "the view must be centre-able and pannable".

### 1.2 Zoom

| Action | Gesture | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Fit on screen | `Ctrl+0`, double-click Hand, options-bar Fit | **CS6** |
| 100% (Actual Pixels) | `Ctrl+1`, `View > Actual Pixels` (CS6 label) | **CS6** |
| Zoom In / Zoom Out | `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-`, next preset step | **CS6** |
| Zoom tool click | next preset step, centred on click point | **CS6** |
| Wheel zoom | `Zoom With Scroll Wheel` preference (default off in Photoshop) | **CS6**; this app's wheel zoom is always-on, i.e. a deviation to note |
| Max / min | 3200% max, 1-pixel effective min; Zoom In/Out disable at bounds | **CS6** |

- **CS6:** the zoom ladder is a **preset sequence**, not a fixed multiplier.
  Only 25 / 33.3 / 50 / 66.7 / 100 are sourced; the full ladder
  (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 25, 33.3, 50, 66.7, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800,
  1200, 1600, 2400, 3200 %) is inferred. Exact CS6 set remains unverified
  (open question in TOOL-042).
- **Current code:** `zoomIn`/`zoomOut` step by a fixed ×1.2/÷1.2, and the wheel
  uses `pow(1.0015, angleDelta)` (`image_view.cpp:38-58`). Neither follows a
  preset ladder. The spec requirement is the ladder; the exact fraction is a
  follow-up decision (recommend matching the CS6-observed 25/33.3/50/66.7/100).
- Zoom must not resample or reallocate the document; it is a view transform
  (`ARCH-006` says the transform belongs to the view). Current paint already
  does this: `paintEvent` scales the `QPainter` (`image_view.cpp:124-126`).

### 1.3 Pan

- **CS6:** Hand tool + drag pans. Holding `Space` with another tool temporarily
  gives the Hand tool. Flick panning (OpenGL) is a release-momentum extension.
- **CS6:** the Navigator panel's proxy box pans; the scroll bars pan.
- **Current code:** panning is wired only when `panEnabled_` is true, and
  `setPanEnabled(active_ == ToolId::Hand)` (`tools.cpp:194`, `image_view.cpp:143`).
  So panning works with the Hand tool but **not** with Space (no key handling
  exists), and middle-drag is not handled at all.
- **Required:** middle-button drag pans the canvas **regardless of the active
  tool**; the cursor should reflect a pan (open/closed hand). Middle-drag with
  the left button also held may switch to the rotate/zoom-box form as CS6 does,
  but that is optional here.
- **[ext] Middle-mouse pan is a Kooka Pictura extension.** CS6 does **not** pan
  on middle-drag by default; community threads and third-party AutoHotkey
  scripts exist specifically to add it. Implement it deliberately as an
  extension, documented as such.
- **CS6-sec:** Space+drag is CS6 behaviour and should be added; it is currently
  missing. It differs from middle-drag (which is the extension) and should be
  implemented too.

### 1.4 Status-bar zoom readout

- **CS6:** the status bar is at the bottom of every document window and shows the
  current **magnification** and file size; its triangle opens the view-option
  menu (Document Sizes, Document Profile, Document Dimensions, Scratch Sizes,
  Efficiency, Timing, Current Tool, …). The zoom field is editable.
- **Current code:** `zoomLabel_` reads `canvas->zoom() * 100`
  (`frame.cpp:1322-1343`), updated on `zoomChanged` and on frame refresh. This is
  the right source of truth. Keep all zoom surfaces (status bar, Navigator,
  View menu, Zoom tool) reading/writing the one `ImageView` zoom.

### 1.5 Navigator relationship

- **CS6:** the Navigator thumbnail shows the whole artwork; the proxy/view box
  maps the viewport. Drag the box (or click the thumbnail) to pan, drag the
  slider / type a value / use the mountain buttons to zoom, `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-drag
  to set size+position at once. Panel zoom and the status-bar zoom are the same
  value.
- **Current code:** `NavigatorPanel` owns a slider and Fit / 100% buttons, fed
  by `syncFromCanvas()` and `ImageView::zoomChanged` (`navigator_panel.cpp`).
  It is a separate `QWidget` custom paint, not the GPU pyramid CS6 uses.
- **Required:** Navigator stays in sync with the canvas transform, and its
  repaint must be **coalesced/throttled** so it does not repaint the full
  composite on every `changed` (see §4). The thumbnail should derive from the
  existing display image, not trigger a new full composite.

### 1.6 Behaviour summary

| Behaviour | Source | Current code |
|---|---|---|
| Open fit-and-centre when larger than window | CS6-sec | missing (opens top-left, 100%) |
| 100% centred on `Ctrl+1` | CS6 | `actualPixels` centres, but not bound to shortcut |
| Fit on `Ctrl+0` | CS6 | `fitOnScreen` exists, binding status to verify |
| Preset zoom ladder | CS6 (exact set inferred) | fixed ×1.2 |
| Wheel zoom about cursor | CS6 pref; always-on here | present (`zoomAt`) |
| Hand-tool drag pan | CS6 | present |
| Space+drag pan | CS6 | missing |
| Middle-drag pan | **[ext]** | missing |
| Navigator pan/zoom, synced | CS6 | present, but unthrottled |
| Status-bar zoom readout | CS6 | present |

---

## 2. Move tool behaviour

- **CS6:** with the Move tool, dragging "drags any object onto one of the
  selected layers; all objects on the layer move together." The layer content
  visibly follows the pointer during the drag; the pointer does not wait for the
  button to be released. Arrow keys nudge 1 px, `Shift`+arrow 10 px.
- **CS6-sec:** a series of nudges counts as **one** history step; by extension a
  single drag is one committed move. One history state per commit.
- **CS6:** `Show Transform Controls` (formerly *Show Bounding Box*) draws a
  bounding box + handles on the active layer/selection; the handles drive
  scale/rotate without entering Free Transform. `View > Show > Layer Edges`
  outlines the selected layer's content.
- **Current code:** `ToolController::handleMoved` for `Move` only accumulates
  `totalDelta_` and returns (`tools.cpp:301-305`); the document is not touched
  until `handleReleased`, which calls `PictureView::translate_layer`
  (`tools.cpp:350-357`). So there is no live preview: the layer jumps on
  mouse-up. That is the reported 1–2 s delay (the drag duration plus the commit
  cost).
- **Required:**
  - Preview the moved layer **live** during the drag. Cheapest correct form:
    draw the composited image with an offset translation for the active layer
    (or a simple visual offset of the whole composite while the drag is in
    progress), rather than recompositing per mouse-move. A true per-layer live
    composite is the eventual form (`ARCH-006` dirty-rect recompose), but the
    minimum acceptable preview is "the pixels follow the cursor at frame rate".
  - Show feedback while dragging: the moved layer's bounding-box outline (or
    the `Show Transform Controls` box + handles when the option is on).
  - Commit **once**, on mouse-up, with exactly **one** history state ("Move
    Layer"). Nudges with the arrow keys should also collapse into a single
    history state per burst.
  - The live preview is transient and **not** undoable; `Ctrl+Z` after a move
    reverts the whole move in one step.
  - Out of scope here: Auto-Select, Align/Distribute, Free Transform handles,
    `Alt`-drag duplicate. They belong to TOOL-001.

## 3. Performance budget

### 3.1 Existing targets (ARCH-013)

| Workload | Metric | Budget | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pan (drag) | Frame rate | 60 FPS sustained, 24 MP doc | Target |
| Zoom (scrubby/continuous) | Frame rate | 60 FPS sustained, 24 MP doc | Target |
| Rotate view | Frame rate | 60 FPS, 24 MP doc | Target |
| Brush stroke | Input-to-first-pixel | ≤ 16 ms | Target |
| Brush stroke | Sustained updates | 120 Hz sampling, ≥ 60 FPS redraw | Target |
| Open document, 100 MB PSD | Time | ≤ 2 s | Target |
| Cold start | Time to interactive | ≤ 3 s | Target |

Frame decomposition for pan/zoom: 16.6 ms total; input ≤ 1 ms, core tile gather
≤ 3 ms, GPU composite + present ≤ 8 ms, Qt scene-graph ≤ 2 ms, slack ≤ 2 ms. No
more than 10 ms may be spent in the Rust core and GPU submit path. CPU fallback
is allowed ≤ 2× the GPU target. Acceptance measures **p95 frame time ≤ 20 ms**
over a 5-second gesture.

### 3.2 Proposed interactive targets for this work

These extend ARCH-013 to the canvas and Move tool. All are **Targets** to be
validated on the reference machine.

| Operation | Metric | Proposed budget |
|---|---|---|
| Pan / zoom / hand + middle drag | Present a frame within | 16.6 ms (p95 ≤ 20 ms) |
| Any view gesture on GUI thread | Single input handler blocks GUI thread for | ≤ 8 ms |
| Move drag preview | Frame while dragging | 16.6 ms; no full-document recomposite per mouse-move |
| Move drag event handling | GUI-thread work per `mouseMoveEvent` | ≤ 2 ms (accumulate + repaint request only) |
| Move commit (mouse-up) | GUI-thread time, 24 MP doc | ≤ 100 ms, once; may be O(document) |
| Open / document op / global filter | — | may be O(canvas), bounded by ARCH-013 |
| Brush dab | GUI-thread work per dab | ≤ 16 ms (already a Target) |

### 3.3 What may be O(canvas) vs must be incremental

**May be O(canvas)** (one-shot, not per frame):
- open, save, import;
- document-wide ops (crop, resize, rotate, flip, canvas resize, mode switch);
- global filters and adjustments;
- one **move/transform commit** (building the new composite once) and its
  history snapshot.

**Must be incremental / O(viewport) or O(changed region):**
- pan and zoom (transform only; must not touch document pixels);
- Move-tool drag preview (translate a cached layer/composite; no recomposite per
  event);
- brush dabs (only the dab's bbox, not the whole canvas);
- layer thumbnails (only the layer that changed);
- histogram and Navigator thumbnail (throttled, ideally decimated sampling
  rather than every pixel on every change);
- undo/redo of a move (restore the snapshot, no re-composite storm).

## 4. Hot spots — findings and resolution

Findings from reading the code. Items 1 and 4 (the Move-tool per-event
composite) are **resolved** in the post-M24 pass; items 2, 3, 5, and 6 remain
open.

1. **Double full composite per commit, GUI thread — RESOLVED (Move tool).**
   `PictureView::translate_layer` calls `pictura_render::translate_layer`
   (`crates/pictura-render/src/document_ops/crop.rs:51`), which itself calls
   `recompute` (`composite_rgba`) — then `PictureView` calls `recomposite`
   (`cxxqt_object.rs:931-944`), whose `document_to_image` → `current_buffer`
   calls `composite_rgba` **again** because `doc.layers` is non-empty
   (`cxxqt_object.rs:1829-1840`). Then `buffer_to_image` does a per-pixel
   planar→RGBA loop (`cxxqt_object.rs:1904-1937`) and allocates a fresh
   `QImage`. Two full composites + a full conversion per move/recomposite, on
   the GUI thread. Confirm with a profiler before optimising; the fix direction
   is to composite once with a dirty-rect/incremental path and cache the packed
   image.

   **Measured (post-M24 pass):** a single 1024×1024 two-layer `composite_rgba`
   costs ~**257 ms in the debug build** (the old CMake default) and ~**39 ms in
   the optimized build** (~6.6×). Each Move mouse-move ran `move_preview` →
   `pictura_render::translate_layer` (full composite) then `document_to_image`
   (a second full composite) plus a full planar→RGBA conversion, so two
   composites per pointer event made dragging unusable.

   **Fix 1 — preview in Qt, zero compositing during the drag.** The bridge
   caches a preview: `begin_move_preview()` stores a base image (the document
   composited with the moved topmost raster layer hidden), the layer's own
   image, its document-space top-left, and its opacity; `move_preview_base()`,
   `move_preview_layer()`, `move_preview_x()`, `move_preview_y()`,
   `move_preview_opacity()`, and `end_move_preview()` expose/clear it.
   `commit_move(dx,dy)` applies the real move once (a single composite) and
   records exactly one "Move Layer" state. The old per-event
   `move_preview(dx,dy)` is retained only for the self-test (`// ponytail: slow
   path`). `ImageView::beginMovePreview(base, layer, layerPos, opacity)` +
   `setMovePreviewDelta(delta)` + `endMovePreview()` draw the cached base then
   the moved layer at the live delta (source-over with `setOpacity`) in
   `paintEvent`, so a drag composites nothing. `ToolController` Move press calls
   `begin_move_preview` and seeds the canvas preview; move only updates the Qt
   delta; release calls `end_move_preview`, then `commit_move(dx,dy)` once when
   the delta is non-zero, then `endMovePreview`. Switching tools or rebinding
   the canvas cancels the preview. The committed image is exact because
   `commit_move` runs the real renderer. **Remaining known cost:** the single
   ~39 ms commit composite on mouse-up (item 2's deep clone still applies to
   it). **Limitation:** the live preview is source-over only — non-Normal blend
   modes, layer masks, and clipping are not reproduced mid-drag.

2. **Deep document clone for history on every commit.** `record`
   (`cxxqt_object.rs:1332-1338`) calls `snapshot`, which does `doc.clone()`
   (`cxxqt_object.rs:1340-1347`) — a full copy of every layer's pixel buffers
   plus the composite. For a large document this is the dominant commit cost
   and doubles work on top of the double composite. Investigate a copy-on-write
   or delta snapshot for moves.

3. **`changed` fans out to every panel, whole-canvas work each time.**
   `addDocument` connects `PictureView::changed` to `PicturaMainWindow::refresh`
   (`frame.cpp:257`); `refresh` calls `retargetDock`, which calls
   `LayersPanel::refresh`, `NavigatorPanel::refresh`, `InfoPanel::refresh`, and
   `HistogramPanel::refresh` (`frame.cpp:555-579`). `LayersPanel::refresh`
   scales a thumbnail per layer via `layer_image` + `SmoothTransformation`
   (`layers_panel.cpp:354-389`); `HistogramPanel::recompute` does
   `convertToFormat(RGB32)` plus an O(canvas) per-pixel scan on the composited
   image (`histogram_panel.cpp:92-112`). This runs on every `changed`, including
   after every move commit and (potentially) during live preview if wired to
   `changed`. Investigate throttling/coalescing, per-panel change scoping, and
   decimated histogram sampling.

4. **No live preview in the Move tool — RESOLVED.** Originally
   `ToolController::handleMoved` for Move accumulated delta only
   (`tools.cpp:301-305`) and `translate_layer` ran on release
   (`tools.cpp:350-357`), so the layer jumped on mouse-up. Now the drag updates
   only a Qt-side delta over the cached preview (fix 1 under item 1 above) and
   `commit_move` runs the real renderer once on release; no per-event
   recomposite is added.

5. **Pan gating and missing gestures.** `ImageView::mousePressEvent` starts a
   pan only for `Qt::LeftButton` and only when `panEnabled_`
   (`image_view.cpp:141-151`); `panEnabled_` is only true for the Hand tool.
   Middle-button events fall through to the tool signal and are ignored
   (`tools.cpp:198-202` returns for non-left). No Space key handling exists.
   This is cause of problem 3, and Space+drag is a CS6 gap.

6. **Open view reset.** `setImage` zeroes the offset (`image_view.cpp:24-30`),
   producing the top-left placement in problem 2. `fitOnScreen` exists but is
   not called on open/new. `Frame::refresh` also calls `setImage` whenever
   `has_document()` is false (`frame.cpp:565`), so the reset can re-fire.

---

## 5. Acceptance checks

These are runnable by hand or as a small test harness with no framework
requirements. The Move-tool preview and history checks now have an automated
counterpart in the app self-test (exit codes 64–67; `m25_move preview=1 hist=1
undo=1` and `m25_preview_cache began=1 base=1 layer=1 hist_unchanged=1`).

1. **Open placement.** Open a PNG/PSD larger than the viewport. The image is
   fully visible and centred; the status-bar zoom is < 100%. Open a document
   smaller than the viewport: it is shown at 100%, centred (not top-left).
2. **Zoom commands.** `Ctrl+0` fits and centres; `Ctrl+1` shows 100% centred;
   `Ctrl++`/`Ctrl+-` step the preset ladder and disable at 3200% / minimum.
   Status bar, Navigator, and image stay in sync after each.
3. **Live move.** With the Move tool, drag a layer on a ≥ 24 MP document. The
   pixels follow the cursor continuously (no freeze until release). Release
   produces **exactly one** new History entry labelled "Move Layer"; no
   intermediate entries. `Ctrl+Z` reverts the whole move in one step. *(Resolved:
   the drag composites nothing — it draws a cached base plus the moved layer at
   the live delta; only mouse-up runs the real renderer once. Verified by
   `m25_move`/`m25_preview_cache` above.)*
4. **Move feedback.** With `Show Transform Controls` on, the bounding box and
   handles track the moving layer during the drag and match its final rect.
5. **Middle-drag pan.** With any active tool (Move, Brush, Marquee), middle-drag
   pans the canvas and the cursor shows a pan cursor. Document unchanged; no
   history entry. *(This is the [ext] check; it is expected to fail CS6 parity
   by design.)*
6. **Space+drag pan.** With any active tool, hold `Space`, drag, release:
   pans; releasing `Space` restores the previous tool; no document change and no
   history entry.
7. **Wheel zoom anchor.** Wheel-zoom over a document detail: the point under the
   cursor stays under the cursor.
8. **Frame budget.** Over a 5-second pan/zoom gesture on a 24 MP document,
   measure p95 frame time ≤ 20 ms (ARCH-013 acceptance 1). On the CPU fallback,
   ≤ 2× that.
9. **Move drag does not block.** During a 24 MP Move drag, log GUI-thread time
   per `mouseMoveEvent`; it stays ≤ 2 ms per event and no full-document
   composite runs per event (verified by instrumentation or sampling profiler).
   *(Resolved: a drag only updates the Qt delta over the cached preview; the
   single composite runs once on mouse-up — ~39 ms optimized, ~257 ms debug for
   a 1024×1024 two-layer document.)*
10. **History integrity.** Pan, zoom, Navigator drag, and tool switches add no
    History entries; only committed moves/edits do.
