# Move & Transform

- **Spec ID:** `TOOL-001`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` (Move, Free Transform, Transform submenu, Warp, Puppet Warp, Content-Aware Scale; Extended-only 3D Move modes excluded)
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 added an **Interpolation** pop-up to the Free Transform options bar (per-operation resampling choice); the Move tool option previously named *Show Bounding Box* surfaces as **Show Transform Controls**.
- **Depends on:** `ARCH-002` document-model, `ARCH-006` gpu-rendering-pipeline, `ARCH-007` undo-history, `TOOL-002`/`TOOL-003`/`TOOL-004` (selection sources), `08-selection/selection-model.md`, `08-selection/transform-selection.md`, `05-layers/smart-objects.md`.

> All crate, module, widget, and type names below are **design proposals**. No code exists in this repository.

## CS6 behavior

The **Move tool** (`V`) repositions the contents of the active layer(s), layer groups, selections, and guides. With **Auto Select** enabled it also picks the layer under the pointer: choosing `Layer` selects the top layer whose pixels are under the cursor, `Group` selects the top group (clicking an ungrouped layer selects that layer). Without Auto Select, right-clicking the canvas lists every layer that has pixels under the pointer and lets the user pick one from the context menu.

The Move tool options bar also exposes:
- **Show Transform Controls** — displays the transform bounding box and handles on the active layer/selection so the same scale/rotate gestures as Free Transform are available without entering the command (per the CS6 Help "Transform freely" topic).
- **Align** buttons — Top/Vertical Centers/Bottom/Left/Horizontal Centers/Right edges, aligning selected layers to each other, or to the selection border when one exists (`Layer > Align` / `Layer > Align Layers To Selection`).
- **Distribute** buttons — the same six edges, spacing three or more selected layers evenly (`Layer > Distribute`).
- In Photoshop Extended only, the Move tool additionally exposes 3D object/camera modes (Rotate, Roll, Drag, Slide, Scale; `Shift+V` cycles). Those are an `Extended-only` concern and out of scope here.

Movement: drag on canvas; arrow keys nudge 1 px; `Shift`+arrow nudges 10 px. `Alt`(`Option`)-drag with the Move tool duplicates the selection/layer as it moves. Holding `Ctrl`(`Command`) temporarily activates the Move tool from another tool, except when Hand, Slice, Path, Shape, or any Pen tool is active.

**Transform** is the command family around the selection, layer, layer mask, vector mask, path, vector shape, selection border, or alpha channel:
- `Edit > Free Transform` (`Ctrl+T` / `Cmd+T`) applies rotate, scale, skew, distort, and perspective in one continuous operation, switching between them with modifier keys.
- `Edit > Transform` submenu: `Scale`, `Rotate`, `Skew`, `Distort`, `Perspective`, `Warp`, `Rotate 180°`, `Rotate 90° CW`, `Rotate 90° CCW`, `Flip Horizontal`, `Flip Vertical`, `Again` (`Ctrl+Shift+T`).
- When the target is a whole path the menu becomes **Transform Path**; for multiple selected path segments it becomes **Transform Points**.
- `Select > Transform Selection` transforms the selection border itself (not its contents).

All transformations happen around a fixed **reference point**, centred by default. It can be moved by clicking one of the nine squares in the options-bar reference-point locator or by dragging the point in the canvas (it may be placed outside the item). The options bar exposes numeric `X`/`Y` position (with a relative-positioning toggle), `W`/`H` scale percentages with a link-lock for aspect ratio, a rotation angle, and `H`/`V` skew angles. Free Transform can also warp via the **Switch Between Free Transform And Warp Modes** button.

**Warp** (`Edit > Transform > Warp`) deforms via a control-point mesh. A **Warp Style** pop-up selects a preset shape or `Custom`; dragging control points, mesh segments, or mesh interior edits the custom warp; a **Bend** and `X`/`Y` distortion fields give numeric control (disabled for `None`/`Custom`). The warp mesh and control points are toggled with `View > Extras`.

**Puppet Warp** (`Edit > Puppet Warp`) lays a triangulated mesh over the layer and lets the user drop **pins** that either move geometry or anchor it. Options: `Mode` (mesh elasticity), `Density` (mesh-point spacing), `Expansion` (outer-edge expansion), `Show Mesh`, `Pin Depth` (which overlapping pin is on top), and `Rotate` (`Auto`, or `Alt`-drag to rotate about a pin). `H` temporarily hides pins; `Delete` removes selected pins; `Alt`-click a pin with the scissors cursor removes it. It can also be applied to layer and vector masks.

**Content-Aware Scale** (`Edit > Content-Aware Scale`) resizes without uniformly scaling important content. Options: reference-point locator / X-Y position, `W`/`H` scaling percentage with maintain-aspect lock and relative positioning, `Amount` (ratio of content-aware to normal scaling), `Protect` (an alpha channel to protect), and `Protect Skin Tones` (Extended-tagged behaviour documented only in the version-independent Help text).

## Algorithms & pipeline

### Coordinate model

An in-progress transform is a mapping from the item's source space to document space, parameterised by a reference point. Scale/rotate/skew translate to a 3×3 affine matrix; **Perspective** and **Distort** require the full projective (homography) form. Free Transform accumulates successive operations into one matrix and applies the *cumulative* transform on commit, because each committed raster resample loses sharpness:

```text
state := identity (or homography)
on gesture: state := gesture_matrix * state
on commit:  resample once with state, using selected interpolation
```

Photoshop explicitly recommends performing several manipulations before applying, because each committed transformation resamples the raster and makes the image slightly less sharp.

### Interpolation / resampling

The CS6 Help defines the resampling kernels (shared with `Image > Image Size`): **Nearest Neighbor** (pixel replication, hard edges), **Bilinear** (2×2 weighted average), **Bicubic** (4×4 neighborhood, smoother tonal gradation, default), **Bicubic Smoother** (enlargement), **Bicubic Sharper** (reduction, with sharpening). CS6 added **Bicubic Automatic**, which picks smoother when scaling up and sharper when scaling down. A CS6-specific detail confirmed by a third-party CS6 review: the Free Transform options bar carries this menu for ordinary layers, but **Smart Object** transforms ignore it and use the preference default.

### Reference point and numeric fields

Bounding-box handles are computed in source space and mapped through the live matrix. The reference point is the fixed point of the transform; moving it changes the translation component without changing scale/rotation. Numeric W/H are percentages relative to the initial bounding box; X/Y are absolute document coordinates (or deltas when relative positioning is on).

### Warp

Warp is a **bicubic Bezier patch** deformation: a control grid (Photoshop's default visual mesh is the familiar small grid) is displaced by the user, and the patch interpolates the interior. Preset Warp Styles are parameterised by `Bend` and `X`/`Y` distortion. This is standard Coons/Bezier-patch surface deformation; the exact Adobe patch degree and preset parameters are closed. Mark as *behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD* for preset exactness.

### Puppet Warp

Puppet Warp is a **triangulated mesh** with interactive pins. Moving a pin solves for a deformation that keeps mesh triangles as rigid as possible. The known family of algorithms is *As-Rigid-As-Possible* shape manipulation (Igarashi et al.) with a per-vertex log-polar / rigid-weighted solve; Adobe's exact solver and `Mode` elasticity weights are closed. Proposed implementation: Delaunay/regular triangulation at `Density`, pins as position constraints, iterative ARAP solve, `Expansion` as a border offset, `Rigid`/`Normal`/`Distort` mapping to stiffness weights. Mark inferred.

### Content-Aware Scale

Photoshop scales the "unimportant" pixels while protecting high-energy content. The publicly understood mechanism is **seam carving** (Avidan & Shamir) with forward energy, plus an energy bias from the `Protect` alpha channel and skin-tone detection; `Amount` blends content-aware and uniform scaling. Mark as *behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD*; seam carving is a community-documented match, not an Adobe-published algorithm.

### Align / Distribute

Align computes each layer's non-transparent bounding box from its pixels (or the selection border when aligning to a selection) and translates layer content so the chosen edges coincide. Distribute requires ≥3 items and equalises gaps between consecutive edge positions. These are simple 1-D solvers over per-layer bounds.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_transform::TransformOp` — enum `{ Scale, Rotate, Skew, Distort, Perspective, Warp(WarpParams), }` plus helper constructors for the fixed `Rotate180/90CW/90CCW`, `FlipH/V`.
- `pictura_transform::ReferencePoint` — 3×3 anchor enum + free `Point2` override.
- `pictura_transform::Interpolation` — enum matching the six resample methods; resolved from the options bar or the preference.
- `pictura_transform::Matrix` — `Affine2` fast path and `Homography3` for perspective/distort; `to_inverse()` for undo.
- `pictura_transform::warp::BezierPatch` — control-grid deformation; `WarpStyle` presets.
- `pictura_transform::puppet::PuppetMesh` — `{ vertices, triangles, pins, mode, density, expansion }`; `solve()` returns per-vertex displacements.
- `pictura_transform::content_aware` — `seam_carve(energy: &EnergyMap, protect: Option<&Mask>, amount: f32)`.
- `pictura_imageops::resample` — `resample(src, matrix, interpolation) -> TileStore`; separable kernels for bilinear/bicubic, per-pixel nearest.
- `pictura_tools::move` — `MoveTool`, `AutoSelectMode { Off, Layer, Group }`, `hit_test_layer(doc, pos)`.
- `pictura_tools::align` — `align(layers, edge)`, `distribute(layers, edge)`.
- `pictura_selection::bounds` — non-transparent pixel bounds per `NodeId` for align/distribute.

Data crossing the boundary: `NodeId(u64)`, `Matrix`/`Homography` as `[f64; 6]`/`[f64; 9]`, `ReferencePoint`, `Interpolation`, and `TransformRecord { target: NodeId, inverse: Matrix, source_tiles: TileSnapshot }`. Pixel tiles stay in the core and are not marshalled as Qt image types per tile.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `MoveToolOptionsBar` | `QWidget` | Auto Select check + `QComboBox` (Layer/Group); Show Transform Controls check |
| `AlignDistributeBar` | `QToolBar`/`QWidget` | Six align + six distribute `QToolButton`s, enabled by selection count |
| `TransformOptionsBar` | `QWidget` | Reference point, X/Y/W/H/angle/skew spin boxes, interpolation `QComboBox`, commit/cancel |
| `ReferencePointWidget` | `QWidget` | 3×3 locator; custom `paintEvent`/hit test |
| `InterpolationComboBox` | `QComboBox` | Six resample methods; disabled for Smart Objects |
| `TransformOverlay` | `QGraphicsItem` | Bounding box, 8 handles, rotation zone, live matrix, reference point |
| `WarpMeshOverlay` | `QGraphicsItem` | Warp control grid, mesh drag, bend/X/Y binding |
| `PuppetMeshOverlay` | `QGraphicsItem` | Mesh triangles, pins, pin depth, rotate cursor |
| `PuppetWarpOptionsBar` | `QWidget` | Mode/Density `QComboBox`, Expansion `QSpinBox`, Show Mesh check, Rotate |
| `ContentAwareScaleOptionsBar` | `QWidget` | Amount slider, Protect channel combo, Protect Skin Tones check |

Widgets over QML for consistency with `ARCH-003`: these are dense, keyboard-centric, docked-bar controls. The overlays live in the `QGraphicsView` vector layer described in `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md`, above the GPU-composited canvas background.

## Data-model impact

- **Selection/layer masks** are the transform source and destination; transforming a selection writes a new coverage mask (see `TOOL-002`).
- **Undo granularity:** one history state per committed transform. Because a transform resamples pixels destructively, the undo record must either keep the pre-transform source tiles or (for the common affine case) apply the inverse matrix and accept resample round-trip error. Photoshop's history stores the previous state; proposal: keep the source `TileSnapshot` for lossless undo and store the matrix only for Smart Objects.
- **PSD/XMP:** a raster transform is destructive and not serialised as a transform. A **Smart Object** non-destructively stores its transform; PSD carries smart-object transform data in the `Trnf` resource. Puppet Warp pins and warp meshes are not serialised — they are interaction state and are rasterised on commit.
- **Reference point / interpolation** are tool state, persisted in preferences/tool presets, never in the document.
- Puppet Warp pins are interaction-only; on commit they vanish into pixels. Open question whether the app should retain them for re-editing (Photoshop does not).

## Edge cases

- **Background layer** cannot be transformed until converted to a regular layer.
- **Locked layers:** `Lock Position`, `Lock All`, `Lock Image Pixels` gate move/transform; type and shape layers lock transparency/image by default.
- **Selection present:** transforming with an active selection moves the selection's contents; `Select > Transform Selection` transforms the border instead. Selection edges must be transformed with half-pixel coverage to preserve marching-ants fidelity.
- **Bit depth:** 8/16/32-bpc. 32-bit float resampling must not clip or clamp; Bicubic Sharper's implicit sharpening can overshoot float ranges.
- **CMYK/Lab:** interpolation is per channel in the document's space; hue interpolation in Lab is naive per-channel, matching Photoshop.
- **1-px / tiny documents:** handles overlap; numeric entry required; rotation of a 1-px row can produce an empty bounding box — guard against zero-area transforms.
- **PSB / huge docs:** full-image resample may exceed memory; must use tiled/streaming resample with a memory budget and a tiled undo snapshot.
- **GPU unavailable:** transform preview and warp mesh rendering fall back to CPU; overlays are cheap vector work and should not require the GPU.
- **Smart Objects:** non-destructive; the interpolation menu is disabled and the preference default applies; smart filters must be re-evaluated after transform.
- **Puppet Warp** is unavailable on Background layers and on some layer types; recommend Smart Object conversion for non-destructive use.
- **Content-Aware Scale** does not work on adjustment layers, layer masks, individual channels, Smart Objects, 3D layers, video layers, multiple simultaneous layers, or layer groups.
- **Undo/redo** must re-apply or unwind the matrix without cumulative resample loss; repeated commit/resample is an accepted Photoshop behaviour but our undo should be lossless.

## Parity acceptance criteria

- Given a layer with a `Show Transform Controls` checkbox on, dragging a corner handle with `Shift` scales proportionally around the reference point; releasing commits a bounding box whose W/H match the drag within 1 px.
- Given `Edit > Free Transform`, pressing `Esc` restores the item pixel-exact (bit-identical) to the pre-transform state.
- Given a reference point moved to the top-left locator, a 90° rotation maps the bounding box consistently with CS6 (same corner stays fixed) within 1 px.
- Given `Interpolation = Nearest Neighbor`, scaling a checkerboard by 400% yields hard-edged replicated pixels with no new intermediate colours.
- Given `Interpolation` is changed on the Free Transform options bar, the committed result differs from the Bicubic result by more than the noise floor for a scale of 200% (i.e. the choice is actually honoured).
- Given a Smart Object, the Free Transform options bar interpolation control is disabled and the commit uses the preference default.
- Given three layers and `Layer > Distribute > Horizontal Centers`, the horizontal-centre spacing between adjacent layers is equal within 1 px.
- Given a selection and `Layer > Align Layers To Selection > Right Edges`, every selected layer's rightmost non-transparent pixel equals the selection's right edge within 1 px.
- Given `Edit > Puppet Warp` with two pins, moving one pin leaves the pinned anchor area (within its influence radius) displaced less than 1 px.
- Given a Background layer, Move/Transform are blocked with the same "convert to layer" affordance as CS6.
- Given a 32-bit document, applying a transform does not clamp values to `[0,1]` beyond the source range.

- **Exact Bicubic kernel.** Photoshop's Bicubic is not identical to the textbook cubic convolution (Catmull-Rom) and may differ in ringing/overshoot. Resolve with a resample comparison against a CS6 reference image.
- **Content-Aware Scale algorithm.** Seam carving is the community explanation; masking, `Amount` blending, and skin-tone detection are not sourced. Resolve with a public-analysis study or a stated parity tolerance.
- **Anti-aliasing of transformed selection edges.** How Photoshop computes partial coverage for transformed marching ants is unspecified. Resolve by comparing transformed selections against CS6.
- **Move tool `Auto Select` default.** The fetched text describes the option but not its shipped default. Resolve with a CS6 preference capture.
- **Whether to retain Puppet Warp pins / warp meshes for re-editing.** Photoshop discards them on commit; retaining them would be a non-parity enhancement. Decide in `08-selection/transform-selection.md`.
