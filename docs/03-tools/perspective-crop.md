# Perspective Crop

- **Spec ID:** `TOOL-012`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Yes` — the Perspective Crop tool is a separate tool nested under the Crop tool. In CS5 perspective correction was a "Perspective" checkbox on the Crop tool.
- **Depends on:** `TOOL-011` (Crop Tool), `TOOL-017` (Ruler straighten), `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-002`), `01-architecture/undo-history.md`.

## CS6 behavior

Perspective Crop transforms the perspective of an image while cropping. It is
used on images with **keystone distortion** — an object photographed from an
angle rather than straight on (for example, a tall building shot from ground
level, whose edges converge toward the top). Source: CS6 reference,
"Transform perspective while cropping | CS6".

Documented workflow (CS6):

1. Hold down the Crop tool and select the **Perspective Crop** tool.
2. Draw a marquee around the distorted object. Match the four corners of the
   marquee to the rectangular edges of the object. The object **must have been
   rectangular in the original scene**, or the transform will not be what the
   user expects.
3. `Enter`/`Return` completes the perspective crop.

Additional CS6 facts:

- The perspective **Show Grid** option in the options bar displays the
  perspective grid used to align the vertical/horizontal lines of the subject.
  Source: Photoshop Essentials (perspective crop), CS6 options bar screenshot.
- `Front Image` is available; its shortcut changed from `F` (CS5) to `I` in
  CS6 for both Crop and Perspective Crop.
- A **Clear** button clears the W/H fields (and resolution field if shown).
- In CS5 the crop marquee center point had to stay in place to perform the
  correction ("Do not move the center point … The center point needs to be in
  its original position in order to perform perspective correction"). Whether
  this constraint carries into the CS6 separate tool is not stated in the CS6
  section — see Open questions.
- The CS5 procedure used a marquee with a **Perspective** checkbox and required
  extending side handles while preserving the perspective; the CS6 tool is a
  distinct tool but retains the same edge-matching interaction.
- Widely reported (community): Perspective Crop has no non-destructive option
  and always discards cropped pixels; auto-resampling is not exact, so users
  commonly re-run the crop or stretch the result vertically with Free Transform
  (a PSD round-trip could otherwise be used). Marked inferred.

### Interaction with the Crop tool

| Aspect | Crop tool (`TOOL-011`) | Perspective Crop (`TOOL-012`) |
|---|---|---|
| Toolbox slot | Crop | Nested under Crop; `Shift+C` cycles the group |
| Initial box | Placed automatically on select | Drawn by the user |
| Grid | Composition overlays (Thirds, Grid, …) | Perspective grid (`Show Grid`) |
| Transform | Rotation / straighten only | Projective (four-corner) correction |
| Non-destructive | Available (Delete Cropped Pixels off) | Not offered (inferred) |
| Commit | `Enter`, double-click, or button | `Enter`/`Return` |

| Toolbox (under Crop) | Tool | hold Crop / `Shift+C` | Separate CS6 tool |
| Options bar | Show Grid | — | Perspective grid visibility |
| Options bar | Front Image | `I` | Matches crop to another image; shortcut changed from F |
| Options bar | Clear | — | Clears W/H (and resolution) |
| Canvas | Four corner handles | — | Drag to match object edges |
| Canvas | Edge handles | — | Reshape crop bounds |
| Canvas | Center point | — | CS5 required it to stay fixed; CS6 status unverified |
| Context | Commit | `Enter`/`Return` | |
| Context | Cancel | `Esc` | |

## Parameters & ranges

| Commit / Cancel | Action | — | `Enter` / `Esc` | |

## Algorithms & pipeline

Behavioral description (the exact Adobe implementation is closed; the following
is the standard, well-known approach and is **inferred** unless noted):

- The user's four crop corners define a quadrilateral in source-image space. A
  rectangular object photographed at an angle projects onto that quad under a
  **projective transform** (homography). Recovering the rectangle is the inverse
  problem.
- Estimate the 2-D projective transformation `H` (an invertible 3×3 matrix,
  8 degrees of freedom after scale normalization) that maps the unit rectangle
  to the user's quad, then invert it to map source pixels back to a rectangle.
  A standard direct linear transform (DLT) from the four point
  correspondences, or a closed-form quad-to-rectangle solve, suffices.
- Because `H` is projective (not affine), it preserves straight lines but not
  parallelism or ratios: parallel lines may converge and cross-ratios along a
  line are invariant. This is exactly what removes keystone distortion.
- Output size is the crop box's pixel dimensions; each destination pixel is
  sampled from the source via the inverse homography plus interpolation
  (bicubic by default, consistent with General preferences).
- Only four corner correspondences are observable, so a quad can be mapped to
  any rectangle; the tool's result is therefore user-dependent and "not an
  exact science." Residual error produces the commonly reported vertical
  "squish," because the transform cannot recover information the camera did not
  record (depth/true proportions).
- **Show Grid** draws the homography's line family so the user can align grid
  lines with edges that should be vertical/horizontal.

Implementation notes:

- Solve the homography once per commit; validate non-degenerate quads (no
  three collinear corners).
- Mark as "behavioral parity only, algorithm TBD" for the exact interpolation
  and the precise grid construction.

## Rust module mapping

Proposed:

- `pictura-core::geometry::homography::Homography` — 3×3 projective transform,
  `from_quad_to_rect(quad, w, h)`, `inverse()`, `map_point`.
- `pictura-core::tools::perspective_crop::PerspectiveCropState` — quad, grid
  visibility, output size, `commit()`.
- `pictura-core::render::warp::warp_projective(src, dst, H, sampler)` — tile-
  friendly inverse mapping sampler with CPU/GPU backends.
- Reuses `pictura-core::geometry::transform` and the Crop tool's commit
  plumbing (`TOOL-011`).
- Boundary types: `Quad`, `Homography`, `WarpKernel`, `CropRect`.

## Qt6 component mapping

- `PerspectiveCropTool` — draws the four-corner marquee, edge handles, and
  perspective grid; corner drags recompute the homography preview live.
- `PerspectiveCropOptionsBar` (`QWidget`) — Show Grid toggle, Front Image,
  Clear, W/H/resolution.
- `PerspectiveGridItem` — GPU-accelerated grid overlay (CPU fallback) drawn from
  the current homography.
- Live preview renders through the canvas's existing scene; commit sends the
  quad and output size to the Rust core.

## Data-model impact

- Perspective crop is destructive in CS6 (inferred): commit replaces the
  raster with the warped result and updates canvas dimensions. It should still
  be a single history state.
- If a future non-destructive variant is chosen, store a `PerspectiveQuad` on
  the layer/document alongside `CropRegion` (see `TOOL-011`); not required for
  CS6 parity.
- Undo record: before/after raster region plus transform parameters.

## Edge cases

- **Degenerate quads**: three collinear corners or zero-area quads must be
  rejected without corrupting the document.
- **Corners outside the canvas**: clamp or reject; behavior unverified in CS6.
- **Bitmap/Indexed modes**: color-mode restrictions may apply (inferred).
- **16/32-bit HDR and CMYK/Lab**: warp in the working space; preserve bit depth.
- **Very large (PSB) documents**: homography solve is O(1); the cost is the
  warp over up to 300,000 px per side — tile and cache.
- **GPU-unavailable**: CPU warp fallback with progress and cancellation.
- **Non-rectangular source object**: result is undefined by design; document
  the precondition in UI copy/tooltip.
- **Resampling error**: no automatic vertical correction; matches reported CS6
  behavior.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a frontal photo of a rectangular target with known corners, applying
   Perspective Crop to those corners yields a rectangle whose sides are
   parallel within 1 px at the measured scale.
2. Given a quad that is exactly a rectangle and axis-aligned, the committed
   output equals the plain crop of that rectangle (no resampling drift beyond
   1 LSB).
3. Given a quadrilateral whose corners are collinear (degenerate), the tool
   refuses commit and leaves the document unchanged.
4. Given a quad, straight lines in the source that were straight remain straight
   in the destination (projective invariant) — verified by edge-straightness
   measurement on a checkerboard test image.
5. Given the same input quad and output size, the homography and resampled
   output are deterministic byte-for-byte across runs.
6. Given `Esc`, no history state is added.

## Open questions

- **Does the CS6 center-point constraint still apply** to the separate
  Perspective Crop tool? *Resolves with:* CS6 observation.
- **Exact arbitrary-quad-to-rectangle solve and target size** Adobe uses (and
  whether output size is user-set or derived from the quad). *Resolves with:*
  publicly documenting behavior in tests; not documented.
- **Is Perspective Crop strictly destructive in CS6**, and is Delete Cropped
  Pixels ever exposed? *Resolves with:* CS6 options-bar capture.
- **Grid construction** (1-point/2-point grid, line spacing) used by Show Grid.
  *Resolves with:* CS6 observation.
- **Whether perspective crop is recorded as an action step** and its serialized
  parameters. *Resolves with:* CS6 action/scripting docs.
