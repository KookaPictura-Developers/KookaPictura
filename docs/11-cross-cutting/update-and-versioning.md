# Update and Versioning

- **Spec ID:** `XC-011`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core` for document/format/ABI/settings versioning;
  `Extended-only` for update delivery (CS6's installer/updater has no Linux
  equivalent and is re-specified here).
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 is application version **13.0** (13.0.1
  maintenance update). PSD/PSB file-version fields and the Version Info image
  resource are unchanged from earlier releases; CS6 adds the Auto Save image
  resources (see `XC-012`). Update delivery on Windows/macOS moved to Adobe
  Application Manager / Creative Cloud, outside the application binary.
- **Depends on:** `ARCH-004` build-and-packaging, `ARCH-007` file-formats,
  `ARCH-011` plugin-and-scripting-abi, `ARCH-002` preference-storage,
  `11-cross-cutting/crash-recovery-and-autosave.md`,
  `00-overview/cs6-editions-and-constraints.md`.

> Version numbers and update mechanisms on the Linux side are **design
> proposals**. CS6 specifics not confirmed by a fetched source are marked
> *(inferred)* or *(unverified)* and collected under `## Open questions`.

## CS6 behavior

- **Application version.** Photoshop CS6 identifies itself as version **13.0**
  (with a maintenance release 13.0.1). The version/build appears in
  `Help > About Photoshop` and the splash screen. Adobe's own version numbering
  is a single major number plus a minor/patch (13.0, 13.0.1), not SemVer.
- **Document-format version.** The native file header carries a 2-byte
  `Version` field: **1 for PSD**, **2 for PSB** (Large Document Format), which
  is the only in-band discriminator the format offers. The optional
  **Version Info** image resource (ID `1057`, Photoshop 6.0+) records a
  `4 bytes version`, a `hasRealMergedData` flag, a **writer name** (Unicode),
  a **reader name** (Unicode), and a `4 bytes file version`.
- **Forward compatibility.** Photoshop generally refuses or warns on files
  written by a newer product generation because unknown layer features may not
  survive a round-trip. The exact CS6 wording and behavior for a future-version
  PSD is *(unverified)* — see Open questions. Whatever the wording, the safe
  contract is: a newer document must open read-only or with an explicit warning,
  never silently drop features.
- **Plug-in ABI version.** CS6 loads 64-bit C/C++ plug-ins built with the
  matching toolchain; the binary ABI is tied to the Photoshop release and has no
  runtime minor-version negotiation. A mismatched plug-in simply fails to load.
  Kooka Pictura replaces this with an explicit versioned ABI
  (`ARCH-011`).
- **Settings.** CS6 stores preferences in a version-specific file
  (`Adobe Photoshop CS6 Prefs.psp`); settings are not portable across major
  versions, and deleting/renaming the file resets to defaults. There is no
  documented in-app settings migration; the observable contract is
  "wrong/corrupt store ⇒ defaults" (`ARCH-002`).
- **Update delivery.** On Windows/macOS, CS6 updates are delivered by Adobe's
  updater infrastructure, not by an in-app downloader. Linux has no such
  channel; delivery is re-specified for Flatpak, AppImage, and distro packages
  below. *(The exact CS6 updater product name is unverified here and noted in
  Open questions.)*

## UI surface

| Location | Type | Shortcut | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| About dialog | Dialog | `Help > About Photoshop` | Shows app version, build, Qt, GPU backend, codec versions (proposed extension). |
| Splash screen | Splash | — | Displays version/build during cold start. |
| `--version` | CLI | — | Build/app/format/ABI versions for support. |
| Open/Save version warning | Dialog | — | Future-version document, or feature loss on downgrade save. |
| `Edit > Preferences > Updates` | Preference pane | — | Update channel and check policy (proposed; no CS6 equivalent). |
| Update available notification | Banner/dialog | — | Non-intrusive; never on first launch before the user sees a document. |
| Plugin manager | Dialog | — | Shows plug-in requested vs host ABI major/minor; refuses incompatible. |
| AppStream/metainfo | Metadata | — | Release notes and version history for software centers. |

## Parameters & ranges

| Control | Type | Default | Range / options | Notes |

| `minReaderVersion` | u16 | `1` | `0`…`65535` | Newer value ⇒ read-only open. |
| Plugin ABI major | u32 | `1` | host-enforced | Different major ⇒ refuse load. |
| Plugin ABI minor | u32 | `0` | host-enforced | Host hides fields newer than its own. |
| Settings schema version | u32 | `1` | monotonic | Drives migration chain. |
| Update channel | enum | `stable` | stable, beta, nightly | Flatpak branch or AppImage update-info. |
| Check-for-updates | enum | `manual` | off, manual, on-launch | Default off/manual for privacy. |
| Update method | enum | `package` | flatpak, appimage, distro | Detected at runtime; distro builds never self-update. |
| Keep previous version | bool | on (AppImage) | on/off | AppImage `.zs-old` backup semantics. |

## Algorithms & pipeline

### Application versioning

- **Scheme.** Semantic versioning `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, pre-release and build
  metadata as Cargo/tooling define. Cargo's SemVer rules (major = breaking,
  minor = additive, patch = fix) govern the public Rust crates; the *application*
  version is a product number and does not have to match crate versions.
- **Source of truth.** `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` baked at build time via `build.rs`;
  `git describe` appended as build metadata in non-release builds. One constant
  is the single source for About, `--version`, AppStream, and crash reports.
- **Channels.** stable / beta / nightly, each mapping to a package source
  (Flatpak branch, AppImage update-info, or a distro repo). Channels never mix:
  a nightly does not update to stable (`AppImage` channel rule).
- **Compatibility promise.** Within a MAJOR line, documents and plugins remain
  loadable (forward within minor: additive only). A MAJOR bump may raise
  `minReaderVersion`.

### Document-format versioning and migration

- **In-band.** PSD `Version` 1 / PSB `Version` 2 are the only native
  discriminators; we never repurpose them.
- **Extension.** Kooka Pictura writes `opDocumentVersion` and `minReaderVersion`
  into a private image-resource block (in a reserved plug-in resource range) and
  mirrors them into XMP. Unknown to CS6 and other readers, which preserve the
  block opaquely (`ARCH-007`).
- **Read policy:**

  | Condition | Behavior |
  |---|---|
  | `opDocumentVersion ≤ ours`, `minReaderVersion ≤ ours` | Open read-write; migrate model in memory if needed. |
  | `opDocumentVersion > ours`, `minReaderVersion ≤ ours` | Open read-write, preserve unknown blocks; warn once. |
  | `minReaderVersion > ours` | Open **read-only**; save-as requires a new version or explicit lossy-copy confirmation. |
  | Native `Version` not 1/2 | Refuse with a clear error; do not guess. |

- **Write policy.** A document is written at the lowest version that can
  represent its current features; features introduced later raise
  `opDocumentVersion` and set `minReaderVersion` accordingly. Unknown blocks are
  carried forward verbatim (`ARCH-007`).
- **Migration.** A chain of pure functions `migrate_vN_to_vN+1(model)`; the
  chain is total (never panics) and idempotent. Downgrade is *not* attempted;
  a "save a copy compatible with an older version" path flattens/omits features
  with an explicit warning, and is a separate command.

### Plugin ABI versioning

Follows `ARCH-011` directly: one entry symbol
`kookapictura_plugin_entry_v1`, an `abi_major`/`abi_minor`/`struct_size` header,
capability negotiation, and refusal on major mismatch. Within a major, the host
reads only the struct prefix it knows and treats absent trailing function
pointers as unsupported. A new incompatible revision adds `_v2` rather than
mutating `_v1`. The plugin manager surfaces the mismatch reason.

### Settings migration

- The store carries `prefs_version`. On load:
  1. If absent, treat as version 0 and run the full migration chain.
  2. If **older**, run `migrate_vN_to_vN+1` in order; unknown keys are preserved
     (forward compatibility for rolling back a beta).
  3. If **newer** (downgrade), do not rewrite; load known keys, keep the file
     intact, and warn.
  4. If **corrupt**, back up the file and start from defaults (CS6 contract).
- Migrations are pure key/value transforms with defaults supplied by the
  `PrefsSchema` (`ARCH-002`), so defaults live in exactly one place.

### Update delivery on Linux

Three supported channels with different ownership:

| Format | Update owner | Mechanism | Version visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flatpak** | Flatpak/OSTree + Flathub | `flatpak update`; OSTree deduplicated/delta pulls; branch = channel; signed remote; rollback supported | OSTree commit + app version in metainfo |
| **AppImage** | The application/its self-updater | Embedded update-info; `AppImageUpdate`/`libappimageupdate`; zsync delta; signature check; new file beside old | Embedded update-info; `.zs-old` backup |
| **Distro `.deb`/`.rpm`** | The distribution package manager | apt/dnf/pacman; AppStream release notes | Package version only |

- **Flatpak.** Builds are published to an OSTree repository; `flatpak update`
  pulls changes. Branch names encode the channel (`stable`, `beta`, `nightly`).
  Rollback is a documented Flatpak capability.
- **AppImage.** Update information is embedded (`appimagetool -u`, or
  `UPDATE_INFORMATION`/`UPD_INFO` for `linuxdeploy`); the updater downloads only
  changed bytes (zsync) and writes a new file next to the old one, keeping the
  old file as backup. Follow the AppImage golden rules: **never download without
  explicit consent**, respect system/user/ENV "do not check/do not update" flags,
  do not nag on first launch, use a GUI-consistent update experience, and keep
  the app usable during the update.
- **Distro packages.** The package manager owns versioning; the app must **not**
  self-update (doing so fights the package database). Update checks are the
  package manager's job; the app only displays its version and points users to
  the distro for updates.
- **Privacy.** Update checks are off/manual by default and, when enabled, send
  no unique identifier. This matches the AppImage rule that forced version
  checks are a form of tracking.
- **Runtime detection.** The app detects how it was installed (Flatpak sandbox
  marker, `$APPIMAGE`, package-manager metadata) and selects the matching path;
  it never offers an update method it cannot complete.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_version` — `AppVersion` (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), `BuildInfo`, and
  compile-time constants from `build.rs`.
- `pictura_doc::format_version` — `FormatVersion { native: u16,
  op_document: u16, min_reader: u16 }`; `ReadPolicy` and `WritePolicy` enums.
- `pictura_doc::migrate` — `migrate(model, from, to) -> Result<Model, MigrateError>`
  as a total chain of `Migration` steps.
- `pictura_doc::version_info` — read/write of the Version Info resource (1057)
  and the private `opDocumentVersion`/`minReaderVersion` block.
- `pictura_plugin::loader` — reuses `ARCH-011`'s ABI header validation; exposes
  `AbiCompatibility { Compatible, MinorSkew, MajorMismatch }`.
- `pictura_prefs::migrate` — `PrefsSchema`-driven migration chain; preserves
  unknown keys.
- `pictura_update::method` — runtime detection (`Flatpak`, `AppImage`,
  `Distro`).
- `pictura_update::channel` — `Channel { Stable, Beta, Nightly }` and
  check/enable policy from preferences.
- `pictura_update::appimage` — thin wrapper over `libappimageupdate`
  (`checkForChanges`, background `start()`, `progress`, `.zs-old` handling) with
  consent gating.
- `pictura_update::flatpak` — queries `flatpak`/libflatpak for the installed
  commit and available update; never rewrites the OSTree repo itself.
- `pictura_update::distro` — no-op updater; surfaces the package-manager hint.

Types crossing the Rust↔Qt boundary: `AppVersion`, `BuildInfo`,
`FormatVersion`, `ReadPolicy`, `AbiCompatibility`, `UpdateChannel`,
`UpdateStatus`. No Qt types leak into Rust.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `AboutDialog` | `QDialog` | App/build/Qt/GPU/codec versions; copy-to-clipboard. |
| `NewerDocumentDialog` | `QMessageBox` | Warn on future-version or downgrade-save; offer read-only / save-as-copy. |
| `PluginCompatibilityDialog` | `QDialog` | Show why a plug-in was refused (ABI major/minor). |
| `UpdatePreferencesPage` | `QWidget` | Channel, check policy, consent; part of `PreferencesDialog`. |
| `UpdateChecker` (`QObject`) | cxx-qt | Marshals `pictura_update` into Q_PROPERTYs; emits `updateAvailable`, `progress`. |
| `UpdateBanner` | `QWidget` | Non-modal notification; never shown before first document. |
| `packageVersion` in `.desktop`/metainfo | Metadata | Static per release; generated in the packaging step. |

Widgets (not QML) because these are desktop-native dialogs and preference panes
that must match the CS6 docked-dialog feel; the update checker is a headless
`QObject`.

## Data-model impact

- **New persisted document fields** (in the private image resource and mirrored
  in XMP): `opDocumentVersion: u16`, `minReaderVersion: u16`, `writerVersion:
  String`, plus the existing native `Version` (1/2) and Version Info resource
  (1057) fields `version`, `hasRealMergedData`, `writer`, `reader`,
  `fileVersion`.
- **Opaque coexistence.** CS6 and other readers see an unknown image resource and
  preserve it verbatim; round-trip tests assert that preservation
  (`XC-010`).
- **Preferences** gain `prefs_version` and the update settings
  (`channel`, `check_policy`, `consent`), owned by `ARCH-002`, never written to
  PSD/XMP.
- **ABI metadata** is runtime-only (`PlugInRegistration` in `ARCH-011`), never
  serialized into a document.
- **Undo:** version migration and update settings are not document edits and do
  not enter the History panel. A downgrade "save a copy" that flattens features
  *is* a document command and is undoable as one step.

## Edge cases

- **Open a newer document** — do not panic or silently drop features; read-only
  + warning, and preserve unknown blocks on any subsequent save-as-copy.
- **Downgrade save** — must be an explicit, lossy, warned operation; never the
  default `Save`.
- **Partial extraction of version fields** — missing `opDocumentVersion` means
  "legacy/foreign"; treat conservatively as read-write with preservation.
- **Migration chain gaps or unknown intermediate version** — refuse to migrate
  and open read-only rather than guess.
- **Corrupt/partial preferences** — back up and default, per CS6 behavior.
- **Rolling back a beta** — unknown (newer) preference keys are preserved so the
  beta can be reinstalled without losing settings.
- **Flatpak rollback** — after rollback the on-disk document may carry a newer
  `opDocumentVersion`; read-only + warning path applies.
- **AppImage in a read-only directory** — update cannot write a sibling file;
  surface a clear error, do not corrupt the running image.
- **Distro build offering self-update** — blocked at runtime detection.
- **Update while documents are open** — prompt to save/restart; never kill a
  document or an in-flight save.
- **Offline / metered** — checks are manual by default and respect the
  do-not-check flags.
- **Qt/Rust toolchain skew in Flatpak** — the runtime pins Qt; version mismatch
  with a distro build must be reported, not crash.
- **Clock/timezone** — build timestamps are informational only; never used for
  ordering.
- **ABI minor skew** — load and hide unknown trailing fields; log the skew.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a fresh install, `Help > About Photoshop` and `--version` report the
   same application version, build, Qt, GPU-backend, and codec versions as the
   package metadata.
2. Given a document written by Kooka Pictura at `opDocumentVersion = N`, opening
   it with a reader whose `minReaderVersion ≤ N` succeeds and preserves all
   unknown blocks byte-for-byte on re-save.
3. Given a document with `minReaderVersion` greater than the reader's, it opens
   read-only and the first save requires an explicit save-as-copy warning.
4. Given a PSD with native `Version = 1` and a PSB with `Version = 2`, both are
   detected from the header (not the extension) and handled accordingly.
5. Given a Version Info resource (1057), its writer/reader/version fields are
   parsed, displayed where applicable, and preserved on re-save.
6. Given a plug-in built for ABI major 2 and a host at major 1, load is refused
   and the manager reports a version mismatch; a minor-skewed plug-in loads and
   hides unknown fields.
7. Given a preferences store at schema version `N-2`, launching migrates it to
   `N` without losing known values and preserves unknown keys; a store at a
   newer version is loaded without rewriting the file and a warning is shown.
8. Given the Flatpak build, `flatpak update` moves between commits/branches and
   a rollback restores the previous commit; the app reports the OSTree commit it
   is running.
9. Given an AppImage with embedded update-info and an update available, the app
   downloads only on explicit consent, keeps the old file as `.zs-old`, and
   remains usable during the update.
10. Given a distro-installed build, no in-app self-update is offered and the
    update hint points at the package manager.
11. Given a check-for-updates setting of `off`, no network request is made at
    launch.
12. Given an update is available while a document is open, the app prompts to
    save and restart rather than killing the document.
