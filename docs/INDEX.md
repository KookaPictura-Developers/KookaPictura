# Index

Full file listing with status. Statuses: `planned` (not written), `stub`,
`draft`, `spec'd`, `verified`. See [`README.md`](README.md) for the legend.

> **Status note (2026-09):** the corpus is written. Every spec row below that
> reads `planned` is now `draft` — the per-row column is retained for layout
> only and is superseded by this note. Root docs are `spec'd`. A file is
> `draft`, not `spec'd`, until its area has had a cross-review pass.
>
> **Version corrections:** artboards (CC 2015) and linked smart objects (CC 2014)
> are **not CS6**; see `11-cross-cutting/open-questions.md` §A for the full
> corrected-attribution list.
