# Layer Management UI (Layers Panel)

- **Spec ID:** `LAY-002`
- **Status:** `Draft`
- **Parity tier:** `Core`
- **New in CS6:** `Changed` — CS6 adds **layer filtering/search** at the top of the panel, right-click **color labels**, a Properties panel that edits the selected layer components, simultaneous lock/blend/color edits across a multiple selection, `Rasterize Layer Style`, `00`/`Shift+00` opacity shortcuts, correct opacity/blend display on hidden layers, layer-name tooltips, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` navigation while renaming, and shape-layer names that reflect the tool. The panel layout, visibility, lock, opacity/fill, blend-mode and panel-menu model is otherwise CS5-era.
- **Depends on:** `LAY-001`, `LAY-003`, `LAY-004`, `LAY-005`, `01-architecture/document-model.md` (`ARCH-008`), `01-architecture/qt6-ui-design.md`, `02-ui-ux/panels/layers-panel.md`, `05-layers/layer-filtering-and-search.md`, `05-layers/merge-and-flatten.md`.

> Module and type names are design proposals. Behavior is from the CS6 Help
> reference (cited under `## Sources`); inferred items are marked.

## CS6 behavior

The Layers panel "lists all layers, layer groups, and layer effects in an image."
It is used to show/hide layers, create layers, and work with groups; additional
commands live in the panel menu. Panel anatomy per the Help: **A** panel menu,
**B** layer group, **C** layer, **D** expand/collapse layer effects, **E** layer
effect, **F** layer thumbnail.

### Panel display and options

- **Display the panel:** `Window > Layers` (F7).
- **Panel menu:** click the triangle in the upper-right corner.
- **Thumbnail size:** `Panel Options` in the panel menu.
- **Thumbnail contents:** `Panel Options > Entire Document` shows the whole
  document in each thumbnail; `Layer Bounds` restricts to the object's pixels.
  Thumbnails can be turned off for performance/space.
- **Expand new effects:** `Layers panel Options > Expand New Effects` controls
  whether layer styles/smart filters appear expanded by default.
- **Expand/collapse groups:** click the triangle left of the folder icon.

### Filtering / search (CS6)

Filtering options at the top of the panel "help you find key layers in complex
documents quickly." You can display a subset of layers based on **name, kind,
effect, mode, attribute, or color label**.

1. Choose a filter type from the popup menu.
2. Select or enter the filter criteria.
3. Click the toggle switch to switch layer filtering on or off.

(Detailed per-type criteria and the exact toggle UI are covered in
`05-layers/layer-filtering-and-search.md`; the Help states the six dimensions
above but not every control's widget form.)

### Selecting layers

- Click a layer; `Shift`-click for contiguous, `Ctrl/Cmd`-click for
  noncontiguous. Ctrl/Cmd-clicking **outside** the thumbnail selects; clicking the
  **thumbnail** selects the layer's nontransparent areas as a selection.
- `Select > All Layers`; `Select > Similar Layers` (select a layer, then choose
  to select all like-kind layers).
- Deselect one with Ctrl/Cmd-click; click below the bottom layer (or `Select >
  Deselect Layers`) to have none selected.
- Select in the document window via Move tool **Auto Select** (Layer or Group)
  or the right-click/Control-click layer context menu (lists layers with pixels
  under the pointer).
- Linked layers "retain their relationship until you unlink them"; unlike a
  transient multiple selection. Link/unlink via the link icon at the bottom of
  the panel; `Shift`-click the link icon temporarily disables it (red X).

### Visibility, lock, opacity/fill, blend mode

- **Eye icon** toggles visibility. Alt/Option-click an eye shows only that
  layer/group and remembers prior visibility; a second Alt-click restores.
  Dragging through the eye column toggles multiple rows. Right-click (Windows) /
  Control-click (Mac) the eye offers "show/hide this layer/layer group only or
  all layers/layer groups". Only visible layers print.
- **Locks.** Full lock via **Lock All**. Partial locks: **Lock Transparent
  Pixels** (confines editing to opaque pixels; formerly Preserve Transparency),
  **Lock Image Pixels** (no painting), **Lock Position** (no moving). A solid
  lock icon means fully locked, hollow means partially locked; layers in a locked
  group show a dimmed lock. For type/shape layers, Lock Transparency and Lock
  Image are selected by default and cannot be deselected. `Layer > Lock Layers`
  / `Lock All Layers In Group` applies locks to a selection or group.
- **Opacity** is overall transparency (affects styles and blending modes);
  **Fill** affects only pixels/shapes/text, not effects such as drop shadows.
  Select one or more layers or groups and edit Opacity and Fill. **If a group is
  selected, only Opacity is available.** Background and locked layers cannot
  change opacity.
- **Blend mode** popup in the panel; also via `Layer > Layer Style > Blending
  Options`. There is no Clear mode for layers. See `LAY-001` for mode/depth
  restrictions.

### Create, duplicate, delete, rasterize, export

- **New layer/group:** Create a New Layer / New Group buttons, `Layer > New >
  Layer`/`Group`, or the panel menu. Alt/Option-click the button opens the New
  Layer dialog (Name, Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask [not for
  groups], Color, Mode, Opacity, Fill With Mode-Neutral Color). Ctrl/Cmd-click
  adds below the current layer. `Shift`-click New Group adds the current selection
  to a new group.
- **Layer Via Copy / Layer Via Cut:** with a selection, `Layer > New > Layer Via
  Copy` copies the selection to a new layer; `Layer > New > Layer Via Cut` cuts
  it. Smart Objects and shape layers must be rasterized first.
- **Duplicate:** drag to the Create a New Layer button, or `Duplicate Layer` /
  `Duplicate Group` (panel/menu), optionally into another or a new document.
  Copy/paste duplicates pixels only (no layer properties).
- **Create layer from existing file:** drag a file onto the image (creates a
  Smart Object by default unless the preference is off).
- **Rasterize** (`Layer > Rasterize`): Type, Shape, Fill Content (leaves vector
  mask), Vector Mask (becomes a layer mask), Smart Object, Video, 3D (Extended),
  Layer (all vector data), All Layers. `Layer > Select Linked Layers` first to
  rasterize linked layers.
- **Delete:** Delete icon with confirmation, or Delete Layer/Group from the menu;
  drag to the Delete icon or press Delete (Alt/Option-click the icon) to skip
  confirmation. `Layer > Delete > Hidden Layers`; delete linked layers after
  `Select Linked Layers`.
- **Export layers:** `File > Scripts > Export Layers To Files` (all or visible).
- **Merge** and **Flatten** are covered in `05-layers/merge-and-flatten.md`;
  note adjustment/fill layers cannot be a merge target, and Merge Visible needs a
  visible layer selected.

## Algorithms & pipeline

The panel is a view over the document node tree; it holds no authoritative state.

1. **Model projection.** Flatten the `ARC-008` node arena into display order
   (topmost first), emitting a row per node and a child row per layer effect /
   smart filter. `NodeKind::Group`/artboard rows are expandable.
2. **Roles.** Emit id, name, kind, visibility, lock flags, blend mode, opacity,
   fill, clipping, color label, mask presence, and style badge as item roles.
3. **Filtering (CS6).** A proxy layer filters rows by the six dimensions; the
   toggle enables/disables the proxy. Filters are a view concern and must not
   mutate document state.
4. **Commands, not direct mutation.** Every edit (visibility, lock, opacity,
   fill, blend, color, rename, move, duplicate, delete, rasterize, link) is a
   command with an undo record (`ARCH-009`); the GUI thread queues commands and
   the model/view updates on completion.
5. **CLI parity.** Layer masks are stored as alpha channels; loading layer
   transparency/mask as a selection (Ctrl/Cmd-click thumbnail) shares the
   selection engine (`08-selection/`). *(mechanism inferred)*
6. **Reset semantics.** `Alt`-click solo-visibility snapshots prior visibility so
   it can be restored exactly.

## Rust module mapping

- `pictura_core::document::layer_ops` — command constructors: `NewLayer`, `DuplicateLayer`, `DeleteLayer`, `Reorder`, `SetVisibility`, `SetLock`, `SetOpacity`, `SetFill`, `SetBlend`, `SetColorLabel`, `Rename`, `Rasterize`, `Link`, `LayerViaCopy`, `LayerViaCut`.
- `pictura_core::layer_filter` — `LayerFilter { dimension, criterion, enabled }` and `filter_view(&Document) -> Vec<NodeId>`.
- `pictura_core::rasterize` — `RasterizeTarget { Type, Shape, FillContent, VectorMask, SmartObject, Video, ThreeD, Layer, AllLayers }`, producing replacement pixel nodes and alpha masks.
- `pictura_core::command` (`ARCH-009`) — undo/redo records for each op.
- Crossing types: `NodeId`, `LockFlags`, `BlendMode`, `RasterizeTarget`, `ColorLabel`.

## Qt6 component mapping

| Proposal | Base | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `LayersModel` | `QAbstractItemModel` | Node tree; roles for all panel columns and expandable effect/smart-filter rows. |
| `LayersFilterProxyModel` | `QSortFilterProxyModel` | CS6 six-dimension filtering; enable/disable toggle. |
| `LayersPanel` | `QWidget` (dock) | Header controls (blend/opacity/fill/lock/filter), `QTreeView`, and bottom button strip. |
| `LayerRowDelegate` | `QStyledItemDelegate` | Thumbnails, mask/clip/style badges, indentation/underline for clipping, lock/eye painting, color label. |
| `BlendModeComboBox` | `QComboBox` | Mode list, filtered by color mode and bit depth. |
| `LayerFilterBar` | `QWidget` | Filter-dimension popup, criterion editor, on/off switch. |
| `LayerPropertiesDialog` / `GroupPropertiesDialog` | `QDialog` | Name, color, mode, opacity (and clip-to-previous for layers). |
| `LayersPanelMenu` | `QMenu` | Panel-menu + row context-menu actions. |

Models are GUI-thread-only (`ARCH-003`); mutations go through the command layer.

## Data-model impact

- No new persistent fields beyond `LAY-001`: visibility, lock flags, opacity,
  fill, blend, clipping, color label, and link state already exist on `Node`.
- **Link groups** need a representation (a link-set id on `Node`, or a
  document-level `Vec<LinkSet>`); unlink clears it. *(design choice)*
- **Filter/search** is transient view state, not serialized.
- **Color label** maps to the layer's color field (PSD layer record); CS6's
  right-click editor does not change the value model, only the input path.
- Undo granularity: one state per user action; multi-select edits are a single
  command touching multiple node ids.

## Edge cases

- **Background and locked layers:** opacity/fill/blend/reorder must be refused,
  not silently applied.
- **Group selected:** Fill control is disabled; only Opacity is offered.
- **Type/shape layers:** Transparent and Image locks are forced on.
- **Layer Via Copy/Cut on Smart Objects/shape layers:** must require rasterizing.
- **Adjustment/fill merge targets:** refused.
- **Hidden layers:** must still report correct opacity/blend (CS6 behavior) and
  are excluded from printing/merge-visible.
- **Large selections / PSB:** multi-edit and filtering must stay O(rows), not
  copy pixel data.
- **Filter with no matches:** panel shows an empty view without deselecting the
  underlying active layer.
- **Undo/redo:** reversing a delete restores the node's children, order, masks,
  styles, link membership, and id.
- **GPU unavailable:** panel operations are CPU/command-path and unaffected.

## Parity acceptance criteria

1. Given a document, the panel lists rows top-to-bottom matching PSD/PSD layer
   order, with groups expandable and clipped layers indented under an underlined
   base name.
2. Given a group selected, the Fill control is unavailable and Opacity is
   editable.
3. Given a Background layer, opacity/blend/reorder edits are refused.
4. Given a type or shape layer, Lock Transparency and Lock Image are on and
   cannot be deselected in the lock strip.
5. Given CS6 filtering by each of name/kind/effect/mode/attribute/color label,
   only matching layers are shown, and toggling filtering off restores all rows
   without changing document state.
6. Given multiple selected layers, changing blend mode, lock, or color label
   applies to all selected in one undo step.
7. Given `00` and `Shift+00`, layer and fill opacity are set to 0%.
8. Given `Ctrl/Cmd+J` on a selected group, the whole group is duplicated.
9. Given a selected layer, `Alt`-click solo visibility snaps to that layer and a
   second `Alt`-click restores the prior per-layer visibility exactly.
10. Given a selection on a raster layer, Layer Via Copy creates a new layer
    containing only the selection, and Layer Via Cut additionally clears it.
