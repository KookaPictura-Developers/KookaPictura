# Trademark and Attribution Notice

Kooka Pictura is an independent project. It is not affiliated with,
endorsed, sponsored, or approved by Adobe Inc.

**Adobe**, **Photoshop**, **Camera Raw**, **Adobe Camera Raw**, and
**Lightroom** are trademarks or registered trademarks of Adobe Inc. in the
United States and other countries.

Kooka Pictura uses Adobe marks only nominatively: to identify the Adobe Photoshop
CS6 behavior it reimplements, and to name the documented on-disk PSD/PSB
identifiers required for compatibility with Photoshop. Those identifiers are
reproduced byte-for-byte as required by the file format; examples include the
`Adobe Camera Raw Filter` descriptor class ID and the camera-raw smart-filter id
`2683` that Photoshop writes. Our own camera-raw feature is presented to users
under the descriptive name **Pictura Raw**.

The project ships no Adobe source code, binaries, fonts, ICC profiles, or
creative assets. For the full trademark posture, independent-creation method, and asset
policy, see
[`docs/00-overview/licensing-and-provenance.md`](docs/00-overview/licensing-and-provenance.md).
