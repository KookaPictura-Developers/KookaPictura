# Developing Kooka Pictura

An onboarding guide to the codebase, its build, its tests, and its workflow.
Before your first change, read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): the
provenance and licensing rules there are not optional.

## Orientation

Kooka Pictura is two halves stitched together:

- **Engine crates** (`crates/pictura-*`) — the spec math: document model, codecs,
  color, adjustments, filters, selection, ops, paint, rendering, test
  utilities. They are **Qt-free** and testable headless. `pictura-core` has no
  dependencies.
- **The app** (`crates/pictura-app`) — the only Qt crate. A Rust `staticlib`
  exposes a cxx-qt `PictureView` QObject and links into the C++/Qt `pictura`
  binary. All UI lives in its `cpp/` tree.

```

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|

| `pictura-codec` | PSD/PSB read/write: composite and layer channels, masks, adjustment keys, document channels, image resources and metadata |
| `pictura-color` | ICC profiles (sRGB/AdobeRGB/ProPhoto), convert/assign, intents, black-point compensation |
| `pictura-adjust` | Destructive adjustments and the native-depth kernels |
| `pictura-filters` | Blur, sharpen, noise, stylize, pixelate, distort, render, and the artistic families |
| `pictura-select` | Selection coverage, boolean/modify ops, wand, color range |
| `pictura-ops` | Image resize, canvas size, rotate/flip, arbitrary rotation |
| `pictura-render` | CPU compositor, GPU compositor/filter path, document and layer ops |
| `pictura-testkit` | Golden-image compare/hash and the `pictura-diff` CLI |
| `pictura-paint` | Brush/pencil dab-splatting stroke engine |
| `pictura-app` | cxx-qt `PictureView`, Qt C++ shell, panels, tools, bridge |

The documentation corpus has three layers:

- [`docs/`](docs/README.md) — the long-form behavioral contract: what the
  application is supposed to do. **Read-only unless the task allows docs changes**
  (a `docs/` commit needs `TASK-ALLOWS-DOCS`).
- [`docs/dev/STATE.md`](docs/dev/STATE.md) — the resume anchor: where things
  are right now. Read it first, but treat its counts as a snapshot.
- [`docs/dev/testing-conventions.md`](docs/dev/testing-conventions.md) — how
  every test layer is built and reports; the source of truth for test mechanics.

Where to start: read this file, then `docs/dev/STATE.md`, then the crate that
owns the behavior you are changing.

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.98, pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Qt 6 with the Core, Gui, Widgets, Svg, and Network modules, plus the matching
  `qmake6` (`qt6-base-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- CMake >= 3.24, Ninja, and the `lld` linker.
- Little CMS 2 development headers (`liblcms2-dev`). The C++ binary links
  `-llcms2` because a Rust `staticlib` does not propagate its native link
  dependencies.
- Optional, for the oracle tests: ImageMagick 7 (`magick`) and Python
  `psd-tools>=1.19`. Suites self-skip when these are absent.
- Optional, for the `--interop-probe` diagnostic: Vulkan development headers
  (`libvulkan-dev`). The app and its wgpu GPU path build and run without them;
  the probe compiles to a stub when `vulkan.h` is missing.
- **OpenSpec CLI, pinned to 1.13.2** — required, not optional. It is the spec
  workflow for every non-trivial change and runs entirely from the terminal;
  see [OpenSpec — the required spec workflow](#openspec--the-required-spec-workflow).
- Optional, for symbol navigation and LLM-assisted work: the Serena MCP server
  on `PATH`. See [AI-assisted development](#ai-assisted-development).

## Build and run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/pictura
```

The app is a Rust `staticlib` (`pictura_app`, built by Corrosion from Cargo)
linked into the C++ `pictura` binary. cxx-qt codegen is driven by
`crates/pictura-app/build.rs` and `src/cxxqt_object.rs`. The engine crates stay
Qt-free; only `pictura-app` touches Qt.

`CMakeLists.txt` lists every `.cpp`/`.h` explicitly, so a new source file must be
added there. The CMake configure also links `compile_commands.json` into the
repo root for clangd/Serena C++ navigation; if C++ cross-file references look
fuzzy, reconfigure.

## Architecture and data flow

The engine is the source of truth for pixels and document structure; the app is
a thin Qt shell around it.

- **Bridge.** `crates/pictura-app/build.rs` plus `src/cxxqt_object.rs` drive
  cxx-qt codegen. The Rust-2018 root keeps the `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` and shared
  helpers; concern submodules live under `src/cxxqt_object/`
  (`impl_{core,layers,selection,transform,paint,history,filters}.rs`, and so
  on). Keep the root-plus-directory layout — the generated header path and the
  C++ includes depend on it.
- **Boundary.** Qt decodes images to packed RGBA8888 at the app edge
  (`cpp/decode_image.cpp`); the engine never sees a Qt type.
- **Shell.** `cpp/main.cpp` is startup only: it selects the offscreen QPA plugin
  before `QApplication` for `--headless` (which implies `--self-test` when no
  document is given), then calls `runSelfTest`. Large classes are split across
  several translation units registered in `CMakeLists.txt` (for example
  `frame.cpp` → `frame_{columns,session,menus,build,test}.cpp`).
- **Rendering.** The CPU compositor is the reference; the wgpu/Vulkan path is an
  accelerator, never an oracle. GPU interop notes live in
  `crates/pictura-app/GPU-INTEROP-NOTES.md`.

A typical edit therefore touches: engine crate (math + unit test), the cxx-qt
bridge (expose it), the C++/Qt shell (UI), and `CMakeLists.txt` for any new
file.

## OpenSpec — the required spec workflow

OpenSpec turns work into reviewable change proposals before code is written,
and it is **mandatory for any non-trivial change**. The canonical capability
specs are the contract; a change is a proposal plus validated requirement deltas
plus a task list. You can drive the whole thing from the terminal — no AI agent
is needed. The `/opsx-*` commands and skills under `.opencode/` are conveniences
that wrap the same CLI.

Install the pinned CLI:

```bash
npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec@1.13.2   # >=1.7.0 required for nested specs
```

The day-to-day loop:

```bash
openspec list                                   # active changes
openspec view                                   # one-screen dashboard
openspec show <name> --diff                     # a change and its requirement diffs

openspec new change <kebab-name> --description "..."
# write proposal.md, design.md, specs/<domain>/<capability>/spec.md, tasks.md

openspec status --change <name>                 # which artifact is next
openspec instructions specs --change <name>     # how to write the next artifact
openspec validate <name> --strict
openspec validate --all --strict                # the gate verify-fast.sh runs
openspec archive <name> --yes                   # merge deltas into openspec/specs/
```

Layout and format:

- Changes stay flat under `openspec/changes/<name>/`; only the delta path inside
  a change nests, mirroring the main spec it targets.
- Capabilities live in the two-level tree
  `openspec/specs/{domain}/{capability}/spec.md`. A capability's id is its path
  relative to `specs/` (for example `compositing/layer-compositing`).
- The domains and the mirrored delta-path rule are declared in
  `openspec/config.yaml`.
- Spec format is strict: `### Requirement:` then `#### Scenario:` (exactly four
  `#`), SHALL/MUST wording, at least one scenario per requirement.
- Prefer a new capability name over `MODIFIED` unless the requirement itself
  changes.

After a CLI upgrade, run `openspec update` to regenerate
`.opencode/skills/openspec-*` and `.opencode/commands/opsx-*`, then commit the
diff. The workflow commands are `/opsx-explore`, `/opsx-propose`, `/opsx-apply`,
`/opsx-archive`, and `/opsx-sync`.

## Test and verify

Rust tests are std `#[test]` only (no framework); nextest runs them.

```bash
cargo fmt --all                                  # CI runs --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace                    # one crate/test: -p <crate> [name]
cargo test --workspace --doc                     # doctests; nextest skips them

bash scripts/verify-fast.sh                      # fmt, clippy, test-report, guards, openspec
bash scripts/verify-full.sh                      # CMake build first, then verify-fast
openspec validate --all --strict
```

Oracle suites self-skip when `magick` / `psd-tools` are absent. Profiling and
GPU tests are `#[ignore]`d with a reason string and run with
`--ignored --nocapture`. See
[`docs/dev/testing-conventions.md`](docs/dev/testing-conventions.md) for how
each layer is built and reports.

## Headless

```bash
./build/pictura --headless --self-test [file.psd]
```

`--headless` selects the offscreen QPA plugin before `QApplication` starts and
implies `--self-test` when no document is given, so it never blocks. The first
check asserts the platform is `offscreen`.

The C++ self-test is a hand-rolled sequential oracle in
`crates/pictura-app/cpp/selftest*.cpp`. It emits one
`pictura self-test: PASS|SKIP|FAIL <suite> <name>` token to stderr per check,
closes with `SUMMARY passed=<n> failed=<n> skipped=<n>`, and uses the exit code
as the failure identity: `ST_FAIL(code)` returns its code, and codes are
append-only. Names carry no milestone. The self-test only shrinks — new GUI
checks are Qt Test cases under `crates/pictura-app/cpp/tests/`, not new
`runSelfTest()` checks.

`--interop-probe` requires a real platform Vulkan instance and is not
offscreen-compatible.

## Common tasks

- **Change behavior.** Write an OpenSpec change first
  ([above](#openspec--the-required-spec-workflow)); implement against its tasks,
  then archive it.
- **Add an engine filter or adjustment.** Add to the owning crate
  (`pictura-filters`, `pictura-adjust`, …) with an inline `#[cfg(test)]` unit
  test, then expose it through the cxx-qt bridge and the Qt shell.
- **Add a GUI check.** Add a Qt Test case under `crates/pictura-app/cpp/tests/`
  (registered in `CMakeLists.txt`). Do not add `runSelfTest()` checks.
- **Add a self-test check (shrinking path).** Put it in a `selftest_*.cpp`
  translation unit, take the next free exit code, and register the file in
  `CMakeLists.txt`. Never grow `selftest.cpp`; keep within its
  `scripts/file-size-allowlist.txt` ceiling.
- **Change `docs/`.** A docs change fails `scripts/guard.sh` unless the commit
  carries `TASK-ALLOWS-DOCS` (or you run with `TASK_ALLOWS_DOCS=1`).

## Speeding up local builds

`sccache` is optional. To route Rust compilation through it, export the wrapper
before building or testing:

```bash
export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache
```

`scripts/verify-full.sh` adds `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` to the
CMake configure automatically when `sccache` is on `PATH`. It applies only on a
fresh configure, so delete `build/` to pick it up.

`target/` grows to tens of GB. Reclaim space with `cargo sweep` (install
`cargo-sweep` if you want it) or a plain `cargo clean`.

`scripts/verify-fast.sh` skips fmt, clippy, and tests when every changed path is
`docs/`, `openspec/`, a `*.md`, or under `.serena/`, running only the guard and
spec validation.

## AI-assisted development

The repository is set up for LLM coding agents; a human contributor can use the
same tooling. AI use is optional — see the project's
[`A note on AI`](README.md#a-note-on-ai) — and every contribution is
human-reviewed. The spec workflow itself is
[OpenSpec](#openspec--the-required-spec-workflow), which is CLI-first and does
not need an agent.

### Serena

Serena is a symbol-level MCP server. Its project config and memories are
committed (`.serena/project.yml`, `.serena/memories/`); `cache/`,
`project.local.yml`, and `compile_commands.json` are ignored. The MCP server is
declared in `opencode.json`, so it needs the `serena` executable on `PATH`.
After a fresh clone, index the project once:

```bash
serena project index
```

Serena updates the index itself as files change. C++ cross-file navigation reads
`compile_commands.json` from the repo root, which the CMake configure links from
`build/`; reconfigure if it is missing.

### How the pieces divide

- `AGENTS.md` — the agent rules (verification, git, non-goals); `CLAUDE.md` just
  imports it.
- `.opencode/` — the OpenSpec skills and slash commands (wrappers over the CLI).
- `.serena/memories/` — durable project knowledge; update it when architecture
  or conventions change.
- `docs/` — the long-form contract, read-only unless the task allows it.

## Conventions

- **Definition of done.** Non-trivial logic (a branch, loop, parser, or
  money/security path) ships with one runnable check: a unit test, a `demo()`
  self-check, or an integration test. Trivial one-liners need none.
- **File size.** Target under 800 LOC; hard cap 1200 for code and 1400 for
  tests. A file over its cap must be listed in
  `scripts/file-size-allowlist.txt`, a ceiling that only shrinks.
- **No unrequested abstractions, no new dependencies** without a stated reason.
- **Milestones (`mNN`) live only in comments, docs, and specs** — never in
  identifiers, string literals, or test names
  (`scripts/check-milestone-names.py`).
- **Docs are gated.** A change under `docs/` fails `scripts/guard.sh` unless the
  commit message carries `TASK-ALLOWS-DOCS` (or you run with
  `TASK_ALLOWS_DOCS=1`).
- **Spec workflow.** Per-change requirements live in `openspec/changes/<name>/`
  and are validated with `openspec validate --all --strict`; archiving merges
  them into `openspec/specs/`.
- **Never weaken a test to make CI pass.** A changed golden baseline needs an
  explicit note in the task result.

## Releases

Releases are automated by
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). Every push to
`master` runs `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, which maintains a single
Release PR. Merging that PR writes `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps the version, and tags
the release. The first release is `v0.1.0`; its changelog covers the project
history, since there is no prior release.

Versioning follows Conventional Commits: `fix` bumps the patch, `feat` the
minor, and a breaking change (`!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) the major. To
force an exact version, add a `Release-As: X.Y.Z` footer to a commit before the
Release PR is cut. (The `release-as` config key exists but upstream marks it
deprecated; prefer the footer.)

Three version files are updated together in the Release PR: `version.txt` (the
strategy's version file), `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package].version`), and
`CMakeLists.txt` (`project(... VERSION ...)`); `.release-please-manifest.json`
tracks the last released version. The Cargo and CMake versions are bumped
through the `x-release-please-version` marker on their version line, so keep
that comment when editing them.

`Cargo.lock` is not updated by the Release PR: the workspace-crate versions in
it lag until the next `cargo` command rewrites them, so a release commit is not
`--locked`-buildable until then (`scripts/third-party-licenses.py` uses
`cargo metadata --locked` and will fail first). Packaging workflows must not
assume `--locked` at the tag.

### Release token

`GITHUB_TOKEN` can open the Release PR only if *Settings → Actions → General →
Workflow permissions → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests*
is enabled for the repository and allowed by the organization; both are set
here. It still does not start `ci.yml` or `guards.yml` on the Release PR
(GitHub suppresses runs caused by `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so that PR carries no checks.

That is fine while `master` is unprotected. If required status checks are
enabled, set a `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` secret — a fine-grained PAT with
`contents`, `pull-requests`, and `issues` write — so the PR is authored by a
real token and CI runs on it. The workflow prefers that secret automatically.
The tag points at the Release PR's merge commit, so packaging workflows key off
the release/tag event, not `master`.
