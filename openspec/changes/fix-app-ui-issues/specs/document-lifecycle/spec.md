## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: New document creation
The system SHALL create a new document from a New Document dialog that specifies
name, width, height, color mode, bit depth, and background. Creation SHALL be
supported for 8-bit Grayscale and 8-bit RGB with a white or transparent
background; requests outside that set SHALL be rejected rather than produce a
document the codec cannot write. A new document SHALL be untitled, unmodified,
with empty history and no selection. A document SHALL be created only by an
explicit New, Open, or Place action; launch SHALL NOT fabricate a document, so a
normal launch starts with no document open and the document-requiring commands
disabled.

#### Scenario: Create an RGB document
- **WHEN** the user confirms New with an 8-bit RGB document, white background, and dimensions
- **THEN** a new untitled tab opens showing a document of those dimensions filled white

#### Scenario: Create a transparent document
- **WHEN** the user confirms New with a transparent background
- **THEN** the new document's initial composite is fully transparent

#### Scenario: Unsupported mode or depth is rejected
- **WHEN** a document is requested with a mode or depth the codec cannot write
- **THEN** creation fails and no document is added

#### Scenario: Launch fabricates no document [ldl_no_launch_doc]
- **WHEN** the application is launched with no document argument
- **THEN** no document exists until the user runs New, Open, or Place

#### Scenario: An explicit New creates a document after launch [ldl_new_after_launch]
- **WHEN** the user runs New after a launch with no document
- **THEN** a document is created and the document-requiring commands become
  enabled
