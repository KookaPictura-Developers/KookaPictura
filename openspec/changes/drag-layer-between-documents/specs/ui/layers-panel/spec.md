## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Drag a layer into another document

A Layers-panel drag SHALL carry the document it started from. While dragging,
hovering another open document's tab SHALL make that document active, and
releasing the drag on that tab or on its canvas SHALL deep-copy the dragged
layer (children, masks, effects, and attributes included) into it. The copy
SHALL be placed by the New Layer insertion rule relative to the destination's
current layer, SHALL keep its name and document position, and SHALL become the
selected row, all as one undoable "Duplicate Layer" step. The source document
SHALL be unchanged. A copy of the Background SHALL be an ordinary, unlocked
layer. A drop on the source document's own tab or canvas SHALL copy nothing. A
destination of a different color mode or bit depth SHALL refuse the drop,
leaving both documents unchanged. The Layers panel SHALL NOT treat a drag from
another document as a drop on its rows or strip buttons.

#### Scenario: Drop a layer on another document's tab [lpr_drag_to_document]

- **WHEN** layer `Sky` is dragged from one document onto another document's tab and released
- **THEN** that document becomes active and gains a selected layer `Sky` with
  the same opacity in one undo step, and the source keeps its layers

#### Scenario: Drop a layer on another document's canvas

- **WHEN** a layer is dragged from one document and released on the canvas of another, active document
- **THEN** that document gains a copy of the layer

#### Scenario: A mode mismatch refuses the drop

- **WHEN** a layer of an RGB document is released on a Grayscale document's tab
- **THEN** the Grayscale document is unchanged

#### Scenario: The destination panel ignores the foreign drag

- **WHEN** a drag from one document is released on the Layers panel rows after another document became active
- **THEN** the drop is refused and the active document is unchanged
