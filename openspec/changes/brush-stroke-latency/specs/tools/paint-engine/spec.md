# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Incremental dirty region and dab latency

The paint engine SHALL report an incremental dirty rectangle rather than the
cumulative dirty rectangle of the whole stroke, so compositing after a dab
touches only the pixels that dab changed. The rectangle a present carries SHALL
cover the footprints of the dabs placed since the previous present and MUST NOT
grow with the dabs of earlier presents in the same stroke. The CPU region
compositor SHALL composite only the requested region rather than fully
compositing the document and slicing the result, and a region blit SHALL update
only that region of the presented image instead of invalidating the whole scaled
present cache. The sustained cost of a brush dab on a 4000×4000 document SHALL
meet the canvas-view budget (`docs/dev/canvas-view-spec.md`): input-to-first-pixel
at most 16 ms per dab and a sustained redraw at or above 60 FPS.

#### Scenario: A dab dirties only its own region [lpe_dirty_per_dab]

- **WHEN** a stroke places a dab after other dabs
- **THEN** the reported dirty rectangle covers the dabs since the previous
  present, not the union of all prior dabs of the stroke

#### Scenario: A present covers only the dabs since the previous present
[lpe_dirty_since_last_present]

- **WHEN** several dabs are placed between two presents of the same stroke
- **THEN** the reported dirty rectangle is no larger than the union of those
  dabs' footprints

#### Scenario: Region compositing matches the full composite [lpe_region_equal]

- **WHEN** a region is composited through the CPU region compositor
- **THEN** every pixel in that region equals the full-document composite within
  the compositor tolerance

#### Scenario: A dab meets the canvas-view budget [lpe_dab_budget]

- **WHEN** a brush dab is processed on a 4000×4000 document
- **THEN** the input-to-first-pixel latency is at most 16 ms and the sustained
  update rate is at least 60 FPS, measured against the canvas-view budget
