## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Unified test report

The system SHALL provide a unified end-of-run test report spanning every test
layer: Rust unit, integration, and oracle tests, Rust doctests, the C++
application self-test, and the C++ Qt Test executables. `scripts/test-report.sh`
SHALL run the workspace suite under `cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast`,
run the doctests, run the self-test both with and without a document fixture, run
the Qt Test layer through `ctest --test-dir build -R '^tst_'` (CTest registers
each executable under `build/crates/pictura-app/cpp/tests/` and passes
`-o <CMAKE_BINARY_DIR>/qt-test-results/<name>.xml,junitxml`, so each emits a
per-executable JUnit report), capture each layer's output, and invoke
`scripts/report_tests.py`. The reporter SHALL fold the per-executable JUnit from
`build/qt-test-results/*.xml` and SHALL parse it with the same JUnit parser it
already uses for nextest. The reporter SHALL print, for each suite, a line with
its passed and skipped counts, a subtotal per layer, a TOTAL line, and, when
there are failures, a FAILURES section listing every failed test with its
message. The reporter SHALL use only the python3 standard library, SHALL exit
non-zero when any layer fails, and SHALL accept `--color auto|always|never`.
`scripts/verify-fast.sh` and `scripts/verify-full.sh` SHALL both route through
this same capture-and-report flow, and nextest's own progress output SHALL remain
visible while the run executes.

#### Scenario: Every layer is summarised

- **WHEN** all Rust tests, doctests, self-test checks, and Qt Test cases pass
- **THEN** the report lists a line per Rust suite with its pass count, an
  app-self-test subtotal, a Qt Test subtotal, a doctest line, and a TOTAL with
  the aggregate passed, skipped, and failed counts, and the reporter exits 0

#### Scenario: A failure is listed and fails the run

- **WHEN** any test layer reports a failure
- **THEN** the reporter prints a FAILURES section naming each failed test with
  its message and exits non-zero

#### Scenario: Colour output is selectable

- **WHEN** the reporter is invoked with `--color never`
- **THEN** the report contains no ANSI escape sequences, and with `--color
  always` it contains them even when stdout is not a terminal

#### Scenario: The Qt Test layer is folded in

- **WHEN** `scripts/test-report.sh` runs with built Qt Test executables under
  the build tree at `build/crates/pictura-app/cpp/tests/tst_*`
- **THEN** it runs `ctest -R '^tst_'`, CTest emits per-executable JUnit under
  `build/qt-test-results/`, the reporter parses that JUnit with the same parser
  it uses for nextest, and the layer's passed and skipped counts appear in the
  report
