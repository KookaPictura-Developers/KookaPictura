# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Layer row badges and delegate

The system SHALL draw each row with a delegate that paints, in CS6 order, the
visibility toggle, the thumbnail (a folder glyph for a group), the name, a
clipping-mask indicator for a clipped layer, the clipping indentation and base
underline, the layer-mask thumbnail when a mask is present, and an
adjustment/style badge when adjustment content is present. A layer whose lock
state has any flag set SHALL also show a lock badge at the right side of its
row; an unlocked layer SHALL show none. The visibility toggle SHALL be an eye
icon (`layers.eyeOn`/`layers.eyeOff`) drawn slightly inset from the panel's left
edge and at the same x for every row, independent of nesting depth; the nesting
indentation SHALL apply to the thumbnail and name, not to the visibility toggle.
A layer whose color label is not `None` SHALL tint the **visibility toggle's own
background** (`eyeRect`) with that label color behind the eye glyph, and SHALL
additionally paint a small color-label **chip** — a short bar of the label
color, one row tall — at the start of the row content immediately before the
thumbnail, with the thumbnail and name laid out after the chip so no rect
overlaps; the tint SHALL keep the eye glyph and any selection highlight legible,
and the label color elsewhere on the row SHALL fall back to the row background.
The chip is a paint-only affordance and SHALL NOT alter hit-testing beyond the
thumbnail and name rects accounting for it. A group with at least one child
SHALL show a disclosure icon — right when collapsed, down when expanded — at its
indented position, and clicking that icon SHALL expand or collapse the group. A
**regular (non-group) layer's thumbnail SHALL be drawn over a cached two-tone
checkerboard** so transparency reads under it, while a group keeps its folder
glyph and no checkerboard. **Every thumbnail SHALL carry a 1 px black outline**,
and **when exactly one layer is active** (the same singular active-layer
resolution tool edits use) its thumbnail SHALL additionally show white 1 px
corner brackets drawn one pixel outside the outline; with zero or multiple active
layers no brackets are drawn. A layer whose row reports the smart-object
projection SHALL paint the `layers.kindSmartObject` badge on the thumbnail's
lower-right corner, whether the smart object is embedded or placed/external; the
badge SHALL be omitted when the asset is missing. Row typography SHALL derive
from the layer: a `background` layer's name SHALL be italic/cursive, every other
name normal, and a layer that is a member of the frame's link set or a
placed/external smart object SHALL be underlined through the new
`LayerRowLinkedRole` and `LayerRowPlacedRole` projections. The delegate SHALL
report a row height of at least **28 px** through one named constant used by both
`sizeHint` and the vertical centring math. If an expected icon asset is
unavailable, the delegate SHALL omit that badge while keeping the row legible
rather than fail.

#### Scenario: The visibility toggle is an eye icon [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a layer row is shown
- **THEN** its visibility toggle is drawn from the eye icon asset, and a hidden
  layer uses the off variant

#### Scenario: The eye is left-anchored for every depth [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a nested layer is shown under its group
- **THEN** its eye icon is at the same x as a top-level row's, while its
  thumbnail and name are indented

#### Scenario: The color label tints only the eye toggle [lpr_label_tint]

- **WHEN** a layer with a non-`None` color label is shown
- **THEN** the eye toggle's background is filled with that label color behind
  the eye glyph and a chip of the same color is painted at the row content edge
  before the thumbnail, and the rest of the row background is unchanged

#### Scenario: The label chip sits before the thumbnail [lpr_label_chip]

- **WHEN** a labeled row is shown
- **THEN** the chip is drawn between the disclosure/clipping glyph and the
  thumbnail, and the thumbnail's left edge follows the chip so the two do not
  overlap

#### Scenario: An unlabeled layer has no gutter tint [lpr_label_tint_none]

- **WHEN** a layer with color label `None` is shown
- **THEN** its eye gutter uses the normal row background and no chip is painted

#### Scenario: A smart object shows the badge [lpr_smart_badge]

- **WHEN** an embedded or placed smart-object layer is shown
- **THEN** its thumbnail draws the smart-object badge on the lower-right corner

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer shows no smart badge [lpr_smart_badge_absent]

- **WHEN** an ordinary pixel layer is shown
- **THEN** no smart-object badge is drawn on its thumbnail

#### Scenario: A group shows a disclosure icon [lpr_chevron]

- **WHEN** a group with children is shown collapsed and then expanded
- **THEN** it shows the right-pointing icon when collapsed and the down-pointing
  icon when expanded, and clicking the icon toggles it

#### Scenario: A masked layer shows a mask thumbnail [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a layer carries a layer mask
- **THEN** its row shows a mask thumbnail and the mask-presence flag is set

#### Scenario: A clipped layer shows the clipping indicator [lpc_clip]

- **WHEN** a layer is clipped to the layer below it
- **THEN** its row draws the clipping-mask indicator in addition to the
  indentation and the base layer's underline

#### Scenario: A group row is expandable [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a group has children
- **THEN** its row is marked expandable and shows an expand/collapse control

#### Scenario: A locked layer shows a right-side lock badge [lpc_lockbadge]

- **WHEN** a layer has any lock flag set
- **THEN** its row draws a lock badge on the right side, and an unlocked layer
  draws no lock badge

#### Scenario: A regular thumbnail shows a checkerboard [lpr_thumb_checker]

- **WHEN** a regular (non-group) layer with translucent pixels is shown
- **THEN** its thumbnail is drawn over a two-tone checkerboard, while a group
  row keeps its folder glyph and draws no checkerboard

#### Scenario: Thumbnails are outlined and the active layer is bracketed [lpr_thumb_bracket]

- **WHEN** a regular layer row is shown with a 1 px black thumbnail outline
- **THEN** the singular active layer's thumbnail additionally shows white
  corner brackets one pixel outside the outline, and a multi- or zero-selection
  row shows no brackets

#### Scenario: Row typography follows the layer kind [lpr_row_fonts]

- **WHEN** the rows for the Background, a linked layer, and a placed smart
  object are inspected
- **THEN** the Background name is italic/cursive, ordinary names are normal, and
  the linked and placed rows are underlined through their roles

#### Scenario: The row height has a floor [lpr_row_height]

- **WHEN** a row's size hint is read
- **THEN** its height is at least 28 px from the single named row-height
  constant

#### Scenario: A missing badge asset does not break the row [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** the adjustment badge's icon asset is missing
- **THEN** the row is still drawn and the badge is simply omitted

### Requirement: Panel Options

The system SHALL provide a `Panel Options…` dialog from the panel menu with a
thumbnail size (`None`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`), thumbnail contents
(`Entire Document`, `Layer Bounds`), an `Expand New Effects` toggle, an
`Add "copy" to Copied Layers and Groups` toggle, and a `Use Default Masks on
Fill Layers` toggle. The defaults SHALL be `Medium`, `Entire Document`, and
enabled for the three toggles respectively, and all five values SHALL persist in
the session store, with an older or missing value loading the default. Thumbnail
contents SHALL be resolved when the thumbnail is built: `Layer Bounds` fills the
thumbnail from the layer's own bounds, while `Entire Document` places the
layer's content at its document position scaled into a document-sized thumbnail.
`Expand New Effects` SHALL have no visible effect until effect rows exist. When
`Add "copy"` is enabled, a duplicated layer or group SHALL be named
`"<name> copy"`; when disabled, the copy SHALL keep the original's name. When
`Use Default Masks` is enabled and a selection is active, a fill or adjustment
layer created from the panel or the `Layer > New Fill/Adjustment Layer` menu SHALL
receive that selection as a layer mask; when disabled, the new layer SHALL have
no mask.

#### Scenario: Defaults on a fresh install [m39_options]

- **WHEN** the panel options are read with no saved session values
- **THEN** the thumbnail size is Medium, the thumbnail contents is Entire Document, Expand New Effects is enabled, Add "copy" is enabled, and Use Default Masks is enabled

#### Scenario: Thumbnail contents changes the thumbnail [m39_options]

- **WHEN** a small layer in a large document is shown with Layer Bounds and then with Entire Document
- **THEN** the Layer Bounds thumbnail is filled by the layer while the Entire Document thumbnail shows the layer smaller in its document context

#### Scenario: Options persist [m39_options]

- **WHEN** the user changes any panel-option value and the session is saved and reloaded
- **THEN** the panel restores those values, including Add "copy" and Use Default Masks

#### Scenario: The copy toggle names a duplicate [lpo_copy_name]

- **WHEN** `Add "copy"` is enabled and a layer named `Base` is duplicated
- **THEN** the copy is named `Base copy`

#### Scenario: Disabling the copy toggle keeps the source name [lpo_copy_name_off]

- **WHEN** `Add "copy"` is disabled and a layer named `Base` is duplicated
- **THEN** the copy keeps the name `Base`

#### Scenario: A fill layer takes the selection as a default mask [lpo_default_mask]

- **WHEN** `Use Default Masks` is enabled, a selection is active, and a fill or adjustment layer is created
- **THEN** the created layer carries a layer mask derived from the selection

#### Scenario: A fill layer created without the option has no mask [lpo_default_mask_off]

- **WHEN** `Use Default Masks` is disabled, a selection is active, and a fill or adjustment layer is created
- **THEN** the created layer has no layer mask
