# Spec Delta

## Purpose

Defines the character and paragraph attribute sets, the named character and paragraph styles, the hierarchy that resolves the effective formatting of a run or paragraph, and the app edit that applies them under one history state, so type panels and the text engine share one model.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Character attribute set

The system SHALL model a character attribute set carrying font family, font style, font size, leading (auto or a fixed value), kerning mode (Metrics or a manual 1/1000-em value; Optical has no groundable PSD key and is a deferred approximation), tracking (1/1000 em), horizontal scale, vertical scale, baseline shift, anti-aliasing method (None, Sharp, Crisp, Strong, Smooth), fill colour, and the All Caps, Small Caps, Superscript, Subscript, Underline, and Strikethrough toggles (All Caps and Small Caps are mutually exclusive; All Caps wins). It SHALL also carry the layer-wide Fractional Widths setting. A set created for new type SHALL default both scales to 100 percent, kerning to Metrics, anti-aliasing to Sharp, offsets and spacing to 0, the toggles off, and Fractional Widths on.

#### Scenario: Defaults for new type

- **WHEN** a character attribute set is created for new type
- **THEN** horizontal and vertical scale are 100, kerning is Metrics, anti-aliasing is Sharp, tracking and baseline shift are 0, every toggle is off, and Fractional Widths is on

#### Scenario: Every modelled character field round-trips

- **WHEN** each character field is set to a non-default value and read back
- **THEN** the read value equals the value set for that field

### Requirement: Paragraph attribute set

The system SHALL model a paragraph attribute set carrying alignment (horizontal Left, Center, Right; vertical Top, Center, Bottom), justification (Justify Last Left, Justify Last Center, Justify Last Right, Justify All), minimum/desired/maximum word spacing, letter spacing, and glyph scaling, left, right, and first-line indents, space before and after, hanging punctuation, hyphenation (default off), and composer (single-line or every-line). A set created for new type SHALL default the indents and paragraph spacing to 0, desired word spacing to `[0.8 1.0 1.33]` and glyph scaling to `[1.0 1.0 1.0]`, desired letter spacing to `[0.0 0.0 0.0]`, hanging punctuation off, hyphenation off, and the single-line composer.

#### Scenario: Defaults for new type

- **WHEN** a paragraph attribute set is created for new type
- **THEN** alignment is Left, indents and space before/after are 0, hanging punctuation and hyphenation are off, the composer is single-line, and word spacing is the CS6 justified default `[0.8 1.0 1.33]`

#### Scenario: Every modelled paragraph field round-trips

- **WHEN** each paragraph field is set to a non-default value and read back
- **THEN** the read value equals the value set for that field

### Requirement: Character and paragraph styles with hierarchy

The system SHALL model named character styles (a set of character attributes) and named paragraph styles (a set of character and paragraph attributes) within a `TextStyleSheet`, and SHALL resolve an effective attribute for a run or paragraph by CS6 precedence: a manual override wins over an applied character style, which wins over an applied paragraph style, which wins over the document default. A paragraph style's character attributes SHALL act as the character default for text using it. The document SHALL carry a `Basic Paragraph` paragraph style that is editable but MUST NOT be renamable or deletable. Applying a style MUST NOT clear a manual override already present. A style SHALL be identified by its name, and creating, editing, deleting, or applying a style SHALL be undoable.

#### Scenario: Manual override wins

- **WHEN** text carries a manual character override and an applied character style that sets the same attribute differently
- **THEN** the resolved value is the manual override

#### Scenario: Character style overrides paragraph style

- **WHEN** the same attribute is set by both an applied character style and an applied paragraph style with no manual override
- **THEN** the resolved value is the character style's

#### Scenario: Applying a style keeps an existing manual override

- **WHEN** a style is applied to text that already carries a manual override for one of its attributes
- **THEN** the resolved value for that attribute remains the manual override

#### Scenario: Basic Paragraph is editable but not renamable or deletable

- **WHEN** the document's default `Basic Paragraph` style is renamed or deleted
- **THEN** the operation is refused, while an attribute edit to it is accepted

#### Scenario: Editing a style updates all text using it

- **WHEN** an attribute of a named style is edited
- **THEN** every run or paragraph that applies that style resolves to the new value

### Requirement: Type attribute edits commit as one history state

An edit that applies a character or paragraph attribute set to a type layer SHALL cross the app bridge and record exactly one history state, so a field commit is one undo step. A re-set that carries the layer's existing EngineData SHALL NOT record more than one state, and cancelling an edit SHALL restore the layer bit-identically without a state.

#### Scenario: One attribute edit is one undo step

- **WHEN** a character attribute is applied to a type layer and then undone once
- **THEN** the layer returns to its previous attribute value

#### Scenario: A re-set preserves the layer's pixels until commit

- **WHEN** a type edit is cancelled before commit
- **THEN** the layer's rendered pixels and stored attributes are unchanged and no history state was recorded
