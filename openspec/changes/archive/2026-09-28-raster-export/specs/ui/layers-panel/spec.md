## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Panel and row menus

The system SHALL provide a panel menu and a row context menu. The panel menu
SHALL offer `Panel Options…`, New Layer, New Group, Duplicate Layer(s), Delete
Layer(s), Group Layers, Ungroup Layers, Move Layer Up, and Move Layer Down. The
row context menu SHALL offer those row commands plus Rename and a color-label
submenu containing `None`, `Red`, `Orange`, `Yellow`, `Green`, `Blue`, `Violet`,
and `Gray`. For pixel and smart-object rows the row context menu SHALL also
offer `Export As…` and `Quick Export as PNG`; those two entries SHALL be absent
or disabled on group, adjustment, and type rows. Right-clicking the visibility
toggle SHALL offer show/hide this layer only and show/hide all. The bottom action
strip SHALL remain exactly the CS6 seven buttons, so Move Up/Down SHALL NOT
appear in the strip. Commands that M39 does not implement SHALL NOT be shown in
these menus.
