# raster-export Specification

## Purpose

Qt-boundary encoding of a document's flattened composite to the supported raster
formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, WebP, BMP), with format/quality/scale control, and the
Export As and Quick Export entry points that use it.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Raster output is encoded at the Qt boundary

The application SHALL encode a document's flattened composite to a raster file
using Qt's image writers at the C++ app boundary and MUST NOT add a raster
encoder to the engine crates. The engine SHALL remain Qt-free; the app SHALL
produce a packed RGBA8888 buffer from the composite and hand it to the boundary,
which SHALL build a `QImage` and save it. Supported output formats SHALL be PNG,
JPEG, TIFF, WebP, and BMP, selected by the output path's extension and
independent of case. PNG, TIFF, and WebP SHALL preserve the composite's alpha;
JPEG and BMP, which cannot portably carry it, SHALL be written flattened onto an
opaque background. The boundary SHALL accept a percent scale and SHALL rescale
the image with a smooth filter when the scale is not 100. Writes SHALL be atomic
(temp file plus rename), so a failure never truncates an existing file and a
missing or unwritable path, an unwritable format, or a format the runtime Qt
build cannot write SHALL return failure without producing a partial file.

#### Scenario: PNG preserves the composite alpha

- **WHEN** a document whose composite has a transparent pixel is exported to a `.png`
- **THEN** the written PNG has that pixel transparent

#### Scenario: JPEG flattens alpha onto an opaque background

- **WHEN** a document whose composite has a transparent pixel is exported to a `.jpg`
- **THEN** the written JPEG has that pixel opaque

#### Scenario: BMP flattens alpha onto an opaque background

- **WHEN** a document whose composite has a transparent pixel is exported to a `.bmp`
- **THEN** the written BMP has that pixel opaque

#### Scenario: Scale resizes the output

- **WHEN** a `W × H` document is exported at 50 percent
- **THEN** the written image is `W/2 × H/2` (rounded) and keeps its aspect ratio

#### Scenario: An unwritable target fails without a partial file

- **WHEN** the encode edge is given a path in a directory that does not exist
- **THEN** it returns failure and no file is created

### Requirement: Export As writes the flattened composite

The application SHALL provide `File ▸ Export As…`. It SHALL present a format
choice (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, WebP, BMP), a quality control enabled for the formats
that take one (JPEG and WebP), and a percent scale, then write the document's
flattened composite to the chosen path through the Qt-boundary encode edge. It
SHALL NOT change the document's path, modified state, or history, and SHALL NOT
write a single layer or a selection. A refusal SHALL write nothing and leave the
document unchanged.

#### Scenario: Export As writes a raster without modifying the document

- **WHEN** the user runs Export As, chooses PNG, and confirms a path
- **THEN** a PNG holding the flattened composite is written, the document's path and modified state are unchanged, and no history state is added

#### Scenario: Quality applies only where meaningful

- **WHEN** the user runs Export As and selects JPEG
- **THEN** the quality control is enabled and its value is passed to the encoder

#### Scenario: Export As honors the typed extension

- **WHEN** the user runs Export As with the format combo on PNG but types `photo.jpg`
- **THEN** the written file is a JPEG, because the extension names the format

#### Scenario: Export As on an empty view refuses

- **WHEN** Export As is invoked with no open document
- **THEN** nothing is written and no history state is added

### Requirement: Quick Export as PNG writes beside the source

The application SHALL provide `File ▸ Quick Export as PNG`. With no dialog it
SHALL write `<source stem>.png` beside the document's file and record no history
state. When the document is untitled it SHALL request a path once before
writing. On success it SHALL NOT change the document's path or modified state.

#### Scenario: Quick Export writes next to the source

- **WHEN** Quick Export is invoked on a document saved at `dir/photo.psd`
- **THEN** `dir/photo.png` is written, holds the flattened composite, and no history state is added

#### Scenario: Quick Export prompts once when untitled

- **WHEN** Quick Export is invoked on an untitled document
- **THEN** a path is requested before the write and, once chosen, the PNG is written without re-pointing the document

#### Scenario: Quick Export does not overwrite its own source

- **WHEN** Quick Export is invoked on a document whose own path already ends in `.png`
- **THEN** a path is requested instead of writing the flattened composite over the source file

### Requirement: The Layers row menu exports the composite

The Layers panel row context menu SHALL offer `Export As…` and `Quick Export as
PNG` on pixel and smart-object rows, and SHALL NOT offer them on group,
adjustment, and type rows. Both entries SHALL act on the flattened document
composite — never on the row's layer alone — and SHALL behave exactly as the
File menu commands of the same name.

#### Scenario: Pixel and smart-object rows offer export

- **WHEN** the user opens the row menu for a pixel layer or a smart-object layer
- **THEN** it contains Export As… and Quick Export as PNG

#### Scenario: Group and adjustment rows do not offer export

- **WHEN** the user opens the row menu for a group or an adjustment layer
- **THEN** it does not contain Export As… or Quick Export as PNG

#### Scenario: The row export matches the File menu command

- **WHEN** the user picks Quick Export as PNG from a pixel row's menu
- **THEN** the same file is written as the File menu Quick Export as PNG command writes
