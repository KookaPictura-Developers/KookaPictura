## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Sketch filter application and error contract

The system SHALL implement the 14 CS6 Sketch filters as `Filter` variants and
apply them through the shared `pictura_filters::apply(filter, buf)` entry point.
`apply` SHALL transform every color sample of a planar 8-bit buffer whose channel
count is 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) and return `Ok(())`, or return a `FilterError`
without partially applying; malformed buffers MUST error instead of panicking.

#### Scenario: Apply a Sketch filter to a color buffer

- **WHEN** `apply` receives a Sketch variant and a 3- or 4-channel planar buffer
- **THEN** the color planes are rewritten in place and `Ok(())` is returned

#### Scenario: Malformed buffers error

- **WHEN** the buffer is empty, has zero width or height, or an inconsistent length
- **THEN** `apply` returns a `FilterError` and does not panic

### Requirement: Alpha channel preservation

For 4-channel buffers, every Sketch filter SHALL leave channel 4 bit-identical.

#### Scenario: Every Sketch variant preserves alpha

- **WHEN** each of the 14 Sketch variants is applied to an RGBA buffer
- **THEN** the alpha plane equals the input alpha plane bit for bit

### Requirement: Parameter validation

The system SHALL validate each Sketch filter's parameters before writing any
sample and SHALL reject out-of-range or non-finite values with
`FilterError::InvalidParams` without panicking. The accepted ranges SHALL be:
Bas Relief `detail 1..=15`, `smoothness 1..=15`, `foreground`/`background` RGB;
Chalk & Charcoal
`charcoal_area 0..=20`, `chalk_area 0..=20`, `stroke_pressure 0..=5`; Charcoal
`thickness 1..=7`, `detail 0..=5`, `light_dark_balance 0..=100`; Chrome
`detail 0..=10`, `smoothness 0..=10`; Conté Crayon `foreground_level 1..=15`,
`background_level 1..=15`; Graphic Pen `stroke_length 1..=15`,
`light_dark_balance 0..=100`; Halftone Pattern `size 1..=12`, `contrast 0..=50`;
Note Paper `image_balance 0..=50`, `graininess 0..=20`, `relief 0..=25`;
Photocopy `detail 0..=24`, `darkness 1..=50`; Plaster `image_balance 0..=50`,
`smoothness 0..=15`; Reticulation `density 0..=50`, `black_level 0..=50`,
`white_level 0..=50`; Stamp `light_dark_balance 0..=50`, `smoothness 1..=50`;
Torn Edges `image_balance 0..=50`, `smoothness 1..=15`, `contrast 1..=25`;
Water Paper `fiber_length 3..=50`, `brightness 0..=100`, `contrast 0..=100`.

#### Scenario: Out-of-range parameters are rejected

- **WHEN** a Sketch filter is applied with a parameter outside its range
- **THEN** `apply` returns `FilterError::InvalidParams` and leaves the buffer unchanged

#### Scenario: Boundary values are accepted

- **WHEN** each Sketch filter is applied at the minimum and maximum of its ranges
- **THEN** each returns `Ok(())` without a panic

### Requirement: Determinism and seeding

Every randomised Sketch filter SHALL take a `seed: u64` and SHALL be
deterministic: the same input, parameters, and seed SHALL produce bit-identical
output.

#### Scenario: Repeat applies match exactly

- **WHEN** a stochastic Sketch filter is applied twice with the same seed
- **THEN** the two outputs are bit-identical

#### Scenario: Different seeds differ

- **WHEN** a stochastic Sketch filter is applied with two different seeds
- **THEN** at least one output sample differs

### Requirement: Foreground and background colour inputs

The colour-dependent Sketch filters SHALL take their colours as explicit
`foreground` and `background` RGB parameters: Bas Relief, Chalk & Charcoal,
Charcoal, Conté Crayon, Graphic Pen, Plaster, Reticulation, Stamp, and Torn
Edges. Equal foreground and background SHALL NOT panic or divide by zero.

#### Scenario: Foreground and background colours are honoured

- **WHEN** a colour-dependent Sketch filter is applied with two different foreground/background pairs
- **THEN** the resulting output differs between the two runs

#### Scenario: Equal foreground and background are safe

- **WHEN** a colour-dependent Sketch filter is applied with `foreground` equal to `background`
- **THEN** `apply` returns `Ok(())` without panicking or dividing by zero

### Requirement: Texture options

Burlap, Canvas, Sandstone), `scaling` in `50..=200`, `relief`, one of eight
`light_direction` values, and `invert`. The surface SHALL be generated
procedurally and lit by the chosen direction; the kernel MUST NOT materialize a
canvas-sized texture.

### Requirement: Bas Relief

### Requirement: Charcoal

The system SHALL implement `Filter::Charcoal { thickness, detail, light_dark_balance, foreground, background, seed }` as a posterized, smudged charcoal sketch whose bold edges grow with `thickness` and whose tonal weighting is set by `light_dark_balance`.
