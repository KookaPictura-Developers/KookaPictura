# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Panel set

The system SHALL provide panels for Gradients, Patterns, Properties,
Adjustments, Channels, Paths, and Actions, each with a stable `objectName` and a
CS6-appropriate empty state, in addition to the existing Layers, History,
Navigator, Color, Swatches, Info, and Histogram panels. (The `Libraries` panel
named by the previous revision is not provided by this application; this change
records its absence rather than requiring it.) The panels SHALL be plain
`QWidget` content widgets hosted by the `PanelColumn` rather than
`QDockWidget`s. The default CS6 Essentials set SHALL place `Styles` as a tab of
the `Adjustments` group and SHALL show `Properties` as a standalone panel in the
secondary iconic column; the Gradients, Patterns, and Libraries panels SHALL
remain registered and reachable from `Window > Panels` but SHALL NOT be in a
default visible group. The placeholder panels SHALL show an explicit empty state
rather than fabricated content.

#### Scenario: Every panel exists as a content widget

- **WHEN** the frame is shown
- **THEN** each of the listed panels exists as a `QWidget` with its documented `objectName` and is hosted by the `PanelColumn`

#### Scenario: Properties shows its empty state

- **WHEN** the Properties panel is shown with nothing selected
- **THEN** it displays a "No Properties" empty state

#### Scenario: Styles takes the former placeholder slot

- **WHEN** the frame starts with a fresh session
- **THEN** `Styles` is a default-visible tab of the `Adjustments` group, not the third tab of the Color/Swatches group
