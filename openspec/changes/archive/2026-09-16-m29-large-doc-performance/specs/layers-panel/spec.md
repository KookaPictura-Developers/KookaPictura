## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Thumbnails downsample without a full-size intermediate

Layer thumbnails SHALL be produced by downsampling the layer's channel data
directly, without first materializing a full-resolution RGBA image, so that
thumbnail cost is not proportional to the layer's full pixel buffer. The
thumbnail's visual result SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A thumbnail of a large layer avoids a full-resolution image

- **WHEN** a 24 px thumbnail is generated for a 4000×4000 layer
- **THEN** no full-resolution RGBA image is allocated, the thumbnail is visually
  unchanged, and generation completes within a small time budget
