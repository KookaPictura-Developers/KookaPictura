## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Layer row badges and delegate

The system SHALL draw each row with a delegate that paints, in CS6 order, the
visibility toggle, the thumbnail (a folder glyph for a group), the name, the
color-label swatch, a clipping-mask indicator for a clipped layer, the clipping
indentation and base underline, the layer-mask thumbnail when a mask is present,
and an adjustment/style badge when adjustment content is present. The visibility
toggle SHALL be an eye icon (`layers.eyeOn`/`layers.eyeOff`) drawn slightly
inset from the panel's left edge and at the same x for every row, independent of
nesting depth; the nesting indentation SHALL apply to the thumbnail and name,
not to the visibility toggle. A group with at least one child SHALL show a
disclosure icon — right when collapsed, down when expanded — at its indented
position, and clicking that icon SHALL expand or collapse the group. If an
expected icon asset is unavailable, the delegate SHALL omit that badge while
keeping the row legible rather than fail.

#### Scenario: The visibility toggle is an eye icon [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a layer row is shown
- **THEN** its visibility toggle is drawn from the eye icon asset, and a hidden
  layer uses the off variant

#### Scenario: The eye is left-anchored for every depth [lpr_eye]

- **WHEN** a nested layer is shown under its group
- **THEN** its eye icon is at the same x as a top-level row's, while its
  thumbnail and name are indented

#### Scenario: A group shows a disclosure icon [lpr_chevron]

- **WHEN** a group with children is shown collapsed and then expanded
- **THEN** it shows the right-pointing icon when collapsed and the down-pointing
  icon when expanded, and clicking the icon toggles it

#### Scenario: A masked layer shows a mask thumbnail [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a layer carries a layer mask
- **THEN** its row shows a mask thumbnail and the mask-presence flag is set

#### Scenario: A clipped layer shows the clipping indicator [lpc_clip]

- **WHEN** a layer is clipped to the layer below it
- **THEN** its row draws the clipping-mask indicator in addition to the
  indentation and the base layer's underline

#### Scenario: A group row is expandable [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** a group has children
- **THEN** its row is marked expandable and shows an expand/collapse control

#### Scenario: A missing badge asset does not break the row [m39_badges]

- **WHEN** the adjustment badge's icon asset is missing
- **THEN** the row is still drawn and the badge is simply omitted

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Layers panel header fields

The Opacity and Fill fields SHALL each carry their label as part of the field,
and pressing and dragging that label horizontally SHALL scrub the value exactly
as dragging the field does. Each field's value SHALL display a trailing `%`
sign. The lock strip SHALL hold five toggles; the toggles for alpha, paint,
position, and nesting SHALL be semantic icons describing what they lock
(transparency, image pixels, position, nesting), and only the full-lock toggle
SHALL be a padlock icon.

#### Scenario: Dragging the label scrubs the value [lpr_label]

- **WHEN** the user presses the `Opacity` label and drags horizontally
- **THEN** the opacity percentage changes and is applied in one undo step, the
  same as dragging the field itself

#### Scenario: The value shows a percent sign [lpr_label]

- **WHEN** the Opacity or Fill field is shown
- **THEN** its value is followed by a `%` sign

#### Scenario: Only Lock All is a padlock [lpr_locks]

- **WHEN** the lock strip is shown
- **THEN** the alpha, paint, position, and nesting toggles use their semantic
  icons and the full-lock toggle is the only padlock

### Requirement: Layer drag and drop

A layer row SHALL be draggable. Starting a drag SHALL NOT extend the selection
or begin a rubber-band selection. Releasing a dragged row above or below another
row SHALL reorder it at that position, and releasing it onto a group row SHALL
reparent it as a child of that group, each as one undoable step. The system
SHALL refuse, leaving the document unchanged, a move of the Background layer, of
a fully-locked or nesting-locked layer, of a row onto itself, or of a row into
its own descendant. Dropping a dragged row on a bottom-strip button SHALL apply
that button's action to the dragged row: Delete deletes it, New Layer
duplicates it, and New Group groups it; buttons whose operation is not yet
implemented (mask, link, fx) SHALL be inert.

#### Scenario: Dragging reorders a row [lpr_drag]

- **WHEN** a row is dragged and released above a sibling
- **THEN** the row moves to that position in one undo step and the drag does not
  select any other row

#### Scenario: Dragging onto a group reparents [lpr_drag]

- **WHEN** a row is dragged and released onto a group row
- **THEN** the row becomes a child of that group in one undo step

#### Scenario: A locked or Background row is refused [lpr_drag]

- **WHEN** the Background, a fully-locked, or a nesting-locked row is dragged
  onto another row
- **THEN** the move is refused and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: Dropping on Delete deletes the dragged row [lpr_drop_button]

- **WHEN** a row is dragged onto the Delete strip button and released
- **THEN** that row is deleted in one undo step

#### Scenario: Dropping on New Layer duplicates the dragged row [lpr_drop_button]

- **WHEN** a row is dragged onto the New Layer strip button and released
- **THEN** the row is duplicated in one undo step

#### Scenario: Dropping on New Group groups the dragged row [lpr_drop_button]

- **WHEN** a row is dragged onto the New Group strip button and released
- **THEN** the row is wrapped in a new group in one undo step
