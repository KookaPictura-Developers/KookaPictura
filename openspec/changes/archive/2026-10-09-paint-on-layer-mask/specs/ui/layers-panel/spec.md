## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Layer mask row indicators

When a layer row carries a layer mask, the delegate SHALL draw a link glyph
between the layer thumbnail and the mask thumbnail when that mask is linked to
its layer, and SHALL draw a red cross over the mask thumbnail when the mask is
disabled. When a row carries a vector mask, the delegate SHALL likewise draw a
vector-mask thumbnail with its own link glyph when linked and red cross when
disabled. Clicking a mask's link glyph SHALL toggle that mask's linked state,
and `Shift`-clicking a mask thumbnail SHALL toggle that mask's enabled state,
through the matching bridge; those clicks SHALL be consumed so they do not start
a rename, select another row, or begin a drag. A plain click on a layer mask
thumbnail SHALL make that mask the view's mask edit target through the bridge,
and a plain click on the layer thumbnail SHALL clear the target, so the mask
thumbnail of the targeted row SHALL draw a focus border. The model SHALL expose
the per-row mask and vector-mask linked and disabled states through roles
populated from the bridge.

#### Scenario: A linked mask shows the link glyph [lmk_row_link]

- **WHEN** a row whose mask is linked is shown
- **THEN** a link glyph is drawn between the layer and mask thumbnails

#### Scenario: A disabled mask shows a red cross [lmk_row_disabled]

- **WHEN** a row whose mask is disabled is shown
- **THEN** a red cross is drawn over the mask thumbnail

#### Scenario: Clicking the link glyph unlinks the mask [lmk_row_link_click]

- **WHEN** the user clicks the link glyph on a linked mask row
- **THEN** the mask is unlinked in one undoable step

#### Scenario: Shift-clicking the mask thumbnail disables it [lmk_row_shift]

- **WHEN** the user `Shift`-clicks the mask thumbnail of an enabled mask
- **THEN** the mask is disabled in one undoable step

#### Scenario: A plain click activates the mask [lmk_row_activate]

- **WHEN** the user clicks the mask thumbnail of a row that carries a mask
- **THEN** that mask becomes the mask edit target and the thumbnail draws a focus
  border, with no history state

#### Scenario: A layer-thumbnail click deactivates the mask [lmk_row_deactivate]

- **WHEN** a mask is the edit target and the user clicks that row's layer
  thumbnail
- **THEN** the mask edit target is cleared and the focus border disappears

#### Scenario: A vector mask shows its own indicator [vmk_row_vector]

- **WHEN** a row whose vector mask is linked and enabled is shown
- **THEN** a vector-mask thumbnail is drawn alongside the layer thumbnail with
  its link glyph

#### Scenario: A disabled vector mask shows a red cross [vmk_row_vector_disabled]

- **WHEN** a row whose vector mask is disabled is shown
- **THEN** a red cross is drawn over the vector-mask thumbnail

#### Scenario: Clicking the vector link glyph unlinks it [vmk_row_vector_link_click]

- **WHEN** the user clicks the vector-mask link glyph on a linked row
- **THEN** the vector mask is unlinked in one undoable step

#### Scenario: Shift-clicking the vector thumbnail disables it [vmk_row_vector_shift]

- **WHEN** the user `Shift`-clicks the vector-mask thumbnail of an enabled vector mask
- **THEN** the vector mask is disabled in one undoable step
