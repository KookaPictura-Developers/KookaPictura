# svg-cursors Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m19-svg-icons. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: SVG cursor per tool
The system SHALL provide an original SVG cursor for each implemented tool under
`assets/cursors/`, named by the tool's `tool.<tool>` id, and SHALL expose
`QCursor cursor(const QString& id)` that resolves it to a non-null cursor.

#### Scenario: A known cursor resolves
- **WHEN** `cursor(id)` is called for a bundled tool cursor id
- **THEN** it returns a non-null `QCursor`

#### Scenario: An unknown cursor is null
- **WHEN** `cursor(id)` is called for an id with no asset
- **THEN** it returns a default/null cursor without crashing

### Requirement: Cursor hotspots

Each SVG cursor SHALL define an action hotspot, and the cursor art SHALL place
its action point at that hotspot. The hotspot SHALL be resolved from the frozen
tool catalogue, so each tool uses its documented action point: crosshair-style
selection, crop, path, shape, type, 3D and rotate tools at the centre
`(12,12)`; the Move tool at its compound cursor's arrowhead tip `(2,2)`;
brush-like and sample tools (Eyedropper, Color Sampler, Ruler, Note,
brush, stamp, eraser, fill, blur, toning, healing) at their lower-left tip
`(2,22)`; pen tools at their upper-left nib `(2,2)`; Hand and Zoom at the
pointing finger `(9,2)`. Every hotspot SHALL lie inside `[0, 24) × [0, 24)`.

#### Scenario: Hotspot matches the artwork

- **WHEN** a tool cursor is created
- **THEN** the hotspot is the catalogue's action point for that tool, and the art places its action point there

#### Scenario: An unknown id falls back to the centre

- **WHEN** a cursor is requested for an id with no catalogue hotspot
- **THEN** it uses the centre `(12,12)`

### Requirement: Active tool applies its cursor
The system SHALL set the canvas cursor to the active tool's SVG cursor whenever
the active tool changes or a canvas is bound to the controller. The SVG cursor is
the fallback pointer appearance; a tool MAY additionally draw an in-canvas overlay
(such as the brush-size circle) on top of it, and the presence of an overlay SHALL
NOT change the tool's resolved cursor or hotspot.

#### Scenario: Switching tools changes the cursor
- **WHEN** the active tool changes
- **THEN** the canvas cursor becomes that tool's SVG cursor

#### Scenario: An overlay does not replace the cursor [lsc_overlay_keeps_cursor]
- **WHEN** a tool draws an in-canvas overlay such as the brush-size circle
- **THEN** the tool's SVG cursor remains the pointer appearance and the overlay
  is drawn in addition
