## Requirements
### Requirement: Layer similarity transform entry point and refusal

The system SHALL provide
`pictura_render::transform_layer(doc: &mut Document, path: &str, transform:
LayerTransform) -> bool`, where `LayerTransform` carries `scale_x: f64`,
`scale_y: f64`, `angle_radians: f64`, `dx: f64`, and `dy: f64`. On success it
SHALL resample every channel plane of the layer at `path` into the transformed
bounding rect, update that layer's `rect`, and return `true`. The operation SHALL
refuse and MUST leave `doc` bit-identical when the path does not resolve, the
target is a group, an adjustment layer, or a Background layer, the target is
position-locked, the source rect has zero area, any transform parameter is
non-finite, either scale factor is zero or below a small epsilon, or the
computed result rect has zero area. The operation SHALL NOT recomposite the
document; the caller owns the composite refresh. It MUST NOT panic on any input,
including a 1×1 source.

#### Scenario: A scale and rotation updates the rect and channels

- **WHEN** `transform_layer` is called on a raster layer with a 90° rotation and a 2× uniform scale
- **THEN** it returns true, the layer `rect` is the transformed bounding box, and every channel plane is sized to that rect

#### Scenario: Group, adjustment, Background, and locked targets are refused

- **WHEN** `transform_layer` is called on a group, an adjustment layer, a Background layer, or a position-locked layer
- **THEN** it returns false and every field of `doc` equals its pre-call value

#### Scenario: Degenerate transforms are refused

- **WHEN** `transform_layer` is called with a zero scale factor, a non-finite value, or a source rect of zero area
- **THEN** it returns false and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: The op does not recomposite

- **WHEN** `transform_layer` succeeds
- **THEN** the layer channels and rect change but `doc.composite` is left for the caller to rebuild

### Requirement: Bilinear resampling and coverage rules

The transform SHALL map a layer-local point `p` by
`p' = c + R(θ)·(S·(p − c)) + (dx, dy)`, where `c` is the source rect centre, `S`
is `diag(scale_x, scale_y)`, and `R(θ)` is a clockwise-positive screen-space
rotation matching `pictura_ops::rotate_arbitrary`. The result `rect` SHALL be the
integer bounding box of the four transformed corners: `left = floor(min x')`,
`top = floor(min y')`, `right = ceil(max x')`, `bottom = ceil(max y')`. Each
destination pixel SHALL be sampled with bilinear interpolation from the inverse
map `src = c + S⁻¹·R(−θ)·(q − c) − (dx, dy)`; every channel plane is resampled
independently. A destination whose source point lies outside
`[0, w) × [0, h)` SHALL be written as `0` for every channel (transparent for the
alpha plane, black for colour), and bilinear taps SHALL be edge-clamped. When the
layer carries a `LayerMask`, the mask SHALL be transformed by the same
document-space matrix about its own rect, its `rect` updated to the transformed
bounding box, and out-of-source mask samples written as `0`.

#### Scenario: A scale doubles the plane dimensions and rect

- **WHEN** a `w × h` layer is transformed by `scale_x = scale_y = 2.0` with no rotation or offset
- **THEN** the layer rect and every channel plane are `2w × 2h` and the result is a bilinear resample of the source

#### Scenario: Pixels outside the source are transparent

- **WHEN** a layer is rotated by 45° so the destination bounding box has empty corners
- **THEN** every destination pixel whose source point is outside the source rect has all channels equal to 0

#### Scenario: The mask follows the layer

- **WHEN** a masked layer is transformed
- **THEN** the mask rect is the transformed bounding box, the mask plane is resampled, and out-of-source mask samples are 0

### Requirement: Channel-less embedded smart-object materialization

`transform_layer` SHALL materialize the raster proxy of a channel-less embedded
smart object from its payload before resampling, when `path` resolves to such a
layer and its payload renders through the existing embedded source path. On
success it SHALL drop the smart object, its preserved `SoLd`/`plLd` blocks, and
its linked-source record so no stale untransformed source can survive the
transform. A channel-less target that is not a decodable embedded object SHALL
be refused with no mutation.

#### Scenario: A channel-less placed object is transformed

- **WHEN** `transform_layer` runs on a channel-less embedded smart-object layer with a decodable payload
- **THEN** the layer gains resampled channels, its rect is transformed, and `layer.smart_object` is `None`

#### Scenario: An undecodable channel-less target is refused

- **WHEN** the target has no channels and its embedded payload cannot be rendered
- **THEN** the operation returns false and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: Free Transform session lifecycle and undo contract

The system SHALL provide a modal, per-`PictureView` Free Transform session. It
SHALL begin on an explicit target path, hold the target path, the original rect,
and the current `scale_x`, `scale_y`, `angle_radians`, and `(dx, dy)`, and SHALL
expose press, move, and release callbacks that take document-space image
coordinates and modifier flags. Enter/Return SHALL commit: the session SHALL call
`transform_layer` once, recomposite, and record exactly one history state
labelled `"Free Transform"`. Escape SHALL cancel: the session SHALL end with the
document bit-identical to its state before the session began and with no history
state added. Beginning a session on the path already active SHALL be a no-op;
beginning one on a different path SHALL cancel the active session and start a
new session on the new path. Switching tools, switching documents, or closing
the document SHALL cancel the active session. Committing an unchanged (identity)
transform SHALL record no history state.

#### Scenario: Begin, gesture, commit records one state

- **WHEN** a session is begun on a raster layer, a scale gesture is applied, and Enter is pressed
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Free Transform"` is added and the layer rect reflects the gesture

#### Scenario: Escape restores the document exactly

- **WHEN** a session is begun, a rotation gesture is applied, and Escape is pressed
- **THEN** the document equals its pre-session value and the history count is unchanged

#### Scenario: An identity commit records nothing

- **WHEN** a session is begun and Enter is pressed without any gesture
- **THEN** no history state is added and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: Beginning on the active path is a no-op

- **WHEN** a session is active on a path and begin is called again on that same path
- **THEN** the active session is unchanged

#### Scenario: Beginning on a different path restarts the session

- **WHEN** a session is active on one path and begin is called on a different transformable path
- **THEN** the first session is cancelled without mutating the document and a new session on the second path begins

#### Scenario: Switching documents cancels the session

- **WHEN** a session is active and the active document changes
- **THEN** the session ends without mutating the original document

### Requirement: Transform bounding-box geometry and hit-testing

The system SHALL compute the session's bounding quad as the four corners of the
source rect under the current transform and SHALL draw the quad with eight scale
handles (four corners and four edge midpoints) and a rotate affordance. Hit
testing SHALL be in screen space with a tolerance of 6 screen pixels for handles;
a press inside the quad but away from a handle SHALL move, and a press within a
20 screen-pixel band outside a corner SHALL rotate about the layer centre. The
canvas SHALL show a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical size cursor over a handle,
an open or closed hand while moving, and a cross cursor in the rotate band.

#### Scenario: Dragging a corner handle scales

- **WHEN** the user presses on a corner handle and drags away from the layer centre
- **THEN** the layer scales about the opposite corner and the bounding quad follows the pointer

#### Scenario: Dragging inside the quad moves

- **WHEN** the user presses inside the quad away from every handle and drags
- **THEN** the layer translates by the pointer delta and does not scale or rotate

#### Scenario: Dragging the rotate band rotates

- **WHEN** the user presses in the rotate band outside a corner and drags
- **THEN** the layer rotates about its centre and the quad rotates with the pointer

### Requirement: Scale and rotate modifiers and minimum size

Holding Shift while dragging a corner handle SHALL lock the aspect ratio by
applying one uniform scale factor to both axes; edge handles SHALL always scale
one axis. Holding Shift while rotating SHALL snap the angle to 15° steps. The
session SHALL clamp the transform so the transformed rect keeps at least 1 pixel
in each axis and SHALL refuse a gesture that would produce a zero-area result.
Negative scale factors SHALL be permitted and flip the content. The reference
point SHALL be the layer centre.

#### Scenario: Shift on a corner keeps the aspect ratio

- **WHEN** the user drags a corner handle with Shift held
- **THEN** both scale factors are equal and the layer aspect ratio is preserved

#### Scenario: Shift rotation snaps to 15° steps

- **WHEN** the user rotates with Shift held
- **THEN** the committed rotation angle is an exact multiple of 15°

#### Scenario: A gesture cannot collapse the layer

- **WHEN** the user drags a handle so the transformed rect would have zero width or height
- **THEN** the session clamps to at least 1 pixel per axis and does not commit a zero-area rect

### Requirement: Live preview reuses the move-preview overlay

The session SHALL preview by drawing a cached base composite with the target
layer hidden plus a cached image of the target layer under the current
`QTransform`, reusing the Move tool's cached base/layer overlay. The session MUST
NOT rebuild the document composite on each mouse move. For a channel-less
embedded target the preview layer image SHALL be rendered from its embedded
source without mutating the document.

#### Scenario: A drag does not recomposite

- **WHEN** a session gesture updates the transform
- **THEN** the cached base and layer images are redrawn with the new transform and no document composite is rebuilt

#### Scenario: Previewing a channel-less target mutates nothing

- **WHEN** a session is begun on a channel-less embedded smart object
- **THEN** the document equals its pre-session value until commit

### Requirement: Place starts a Free Transform session

After a successful Place the application SHALL select the newly placed layer and
start a Free Transform session on it, whether the place came through the
`File > Place…` command or a canvas file drop. For a multi-file canvas drop the
session SHALL target the last successfully placed layer and the other placed
layers SHALL remain where they landed. Cancelling the session SHALL leave every
placed layer where it landed, untransformed, and SHALL NOT remove or roll back
the `"Place"` history state recorded by the placement.

#### Scenario: Menu Place enters the session

- **WHEN** `File > Place…` completes successfully with a supported image
- **THEN** a Free Transform session begins on the new layer and the `"Place"` state remains

#### Scenario: Canvas drop enters the session

- **WHEN** one or more supported files are dropped on the document canvas
- **THEN** a session begins on the last placed layer and every placed layer keeps its `"Place"` state

#### Scenario: Cancelling keeps the placement

- **WHEN** a session started by a Place is cancelled
- **THEN** the placed layer remains at its landed rect and the `"Place"` history state is still present

### Requirement: Free Transform resolves the active layer

The application SHALL begin a Free Transform session on the active layer, where
the active layer is the exactly-one layer resolved by the shared active-layer
resolver, rather than defaulting to the topmost raster layer. When no layer is
active or more than one layer is selected, beginning a session SHALL be refused
and the document SHALL be unchanged. The refusal SHALL be surfaced to the user.
An explicit target path supplied by a Place still takes precedence over the
resolver.

#### Scenario: Free Transform targets the active layer [lft_active_layer]

- **WHEN** Free Transform is begun with exactly one layer active
- **THEN** the session targets that layer and its transform updates that layer

#### Scenario: No single active layer refuses [lft_no_active_layer]

- **WHEN** Free Transform is begun with no layer active or with more than one
  layer selected
- **THEN** no session begins, the document is unchanged, and the refusal is
  reported

#### Scenario: A Place target overrides the resolver [lft_place_target]

- **WHEN** a Place starts a Free Transform session on its newly placed layer
- **THEN** the session targets the placed layer even if the resolver would name a
  different layer

### Requirement: Projective (quad) layer transform op

The system SHALL provide
`pictura_render::transform_layer_quad(doc: &mut Document, path: &str, quad:
[(f64, f64); 4]) -> bool`, where `quad` gives the document-space target of the
source layer rect's four corners in top-left, top-right, bottom-right,
bottom-left order. On success the operation SHALL resample every channel plane
(and the layer mask, about its own rect) with the bilinear inverse of the
projective map sending the source corners to `quad`, SHALL set the layer `rect`
to the integer bounding box of `quad` (`floor(min x)`, `floor(min y)`,
`ceil(max x)`, `ceil(max y)`), and SHALL return `true`. A destination pixel whose
inverse-mapped source point lies outside `[0, w) × [0, h)` SHALL be written as
`0`, and bilinear taps SHALL be edge-clamped. The operation SHALL refuse and MUST
leave `doc` bit-identical for every case `transform_layer` refuses, and also when
any corner is non-finite, the projective map is singular or near-singular, or the
result rect has zero area or exceeds the op's pixel ceiling. It SHALL NOT
recomposite the document and MUST NOT panic on any input.

#### Scenario: An identity quad is the source rect

- **WHEN** `transform_layer_quad` is called with `quad` equal to the source rect corners
- **THEN** it returns true and the layer rect and every plane are unchanged

#### Scenario: A translated quad matches the similarity translation

- **WHEN** `transform_layer_quad` is called with every corner translated by an integer `(dx, dy)`
- **THEN** the resulting layer rect and channel planes equal those produced by `transform_layer` with the same translation

#### Scenario: A perspective quad maps the corners onto the targets

- **WHEN** a projective quad with a non-affine corner is applied
- **THEN** the source corners map onto the requested `quad` within a small tolerance

#### Scenario: Degenerate quads are refused

- **WHEN** `quad` has a non-finite corner, three collinear corners, or zero area
- **THEN** it returns false and every field of `doc` equals its pre-call value

#### Scenario: Pixels outside the source are transparent

- **WHEN** a projective quad pulls part of the destination outside the source rect
- **THEN** every destination pixel whose source point is outside the source rect has all channels equal to `0`

### Requirement: Skew, Distort, and Perspective transform modes

The Free Transform session SHALL expose a mode of `Free` (the existing
similarity), `Skew`, `Distort`, or `Perspective`. In `Free` the existing scalars
drive the transform; in a projective mode the session SHALL hold the live target
quad and the scalars SHALL be unused. A corner drag in `Distort` SHALL set that
corner to the pointer; a corner drag in `Perspective` SHALL set that corner to
the pointer and move the opposite corner by the negated delta about the quad
centre; an edge drag in `Skew` SHALL translate that edge's two endpoints by the
same delta, constrained to the edge axis when Shift is held. A projective-mode
gesture that would make the quad degenerate SHALL be refused. Hit testing in a
projective mode SHALL accept only the eight bounding handles; a press away from a
handle SHALL not move or rotate. Committing SHALL call `transform_layer_quad` for
the projective modes and `transform_layer` for `Free`, recomposite, and record
exactly one `"Free Transform"` history state; an identity commit SHALL record
none; Escape SHALL leave the document bit-identical with no history state added.
The precise gesture semantics are inferred from CS6 behavior (no reference image
oracle); the projective map itself is exact.

#### Scenario: Distort commits the dragged corner

- **WHEN** a `Distort` session drags one corner and commits
- **THEN** the layer's source corner is at the pointer's document position and exactly one `"Free Transform"` state is added

#### Scenario: Perspective mirrors the opposite corner

- **WHEN** a `Perspective` session drags a corner by a delta and commits
- **THEN** the opposite corner moves by the negated delta and the quad centre is unchanged

#### Scenario: Skew slides one edge

- **WHEN** a `Skew` session drags an edge handle and commits
- **THEN** that edge translates by the drag delta, the opposite edge is unchanged, and exactly one `"Free Transform"` state is added

#### Scenario: Escape cancels a projective mode exactly

- **WHEN** a projective-mode session is begun, a gesture is applied, and Escape is pressed
- **THEN** the document equals its pre-session value and the history count is unchanged

#### Scenario: A degenerate drag is refused

- **WHEN** a projective gesture would place three corners on one line
- **THEN** the session's quad is not collapsed to a degenerate shape

### Requirement: Skew, Distort, and Perspective menu commands

The application SHALL provide implemented commands `Edit > Transform > Skew`,
`Edit > Transform > Distort`, and `Edit > Transform > Perspective` that begin a
Free Transform session in the matching mode on the active layer, using the same
active-layer resolution and refusal as `Edit > Free Transform`. Each command
SHALL be enabled exactly when `Edit > Free Transform` is enabled.

#### Scenario: The Distort command enters a Distort session

- **WHEN** `Edit > Transform > Distort` is invoked with exactly one transformable layer active
- **THEN** a session begins in `Distort` mode on that layer

#### Scenario: A non-transformable target leaves the command disabled

- **WHEN** the active layer is a group, an adjustment layer, a Background layer, or position-locked
- **THEN** the Distort/Skew/Perspective commands are disabled and invoking them begins no session

### Requirement: Mesh warp op

The system SHALL provide
`pictura_render::transform_layer_warp(doc: &mut Document, path: &str, mesh:
&WarpMesh, params: WarpParams) -> bool`, where `WarpMesh` is a row-major control
net of `rows × cols` points in the source rect's local space and `WarpParams`
carries `distort_h`/`distort_v` percentages. It SHALL resample every channel
plane (and the layer mask, about its own rect) through the tensor-product cubic
Bézier surface defined by the control net, after scaling each row about its edge
midpoint by `1 + (2v−1)·distort_v/100` and each column likewise by `distort_h`.
A destination pixel whose source point lies outside the source rect SHALL be `0`,
and the result `rect` SHALL be the integer bounding box of the forward-mapped
lattice. The op SHALL refuse and leave `doc` bit-identical for every case
`transform_layer` refuses, and additionally when a mesh point is non-finite,
`rows` or `cols` is below 2, or the point count is not `rows·cols`. It SHALL NOT
recomposite and MUST NOT panic. A uniform control net SHALL map a point to
itself (the identity), so an identity mesh leaves the document byte-identical.
The named Adobe warp presets and their `Bend`/`X`/`Y` geometry are out of scope
(no Photoshop oracle); parity is behavioral.

#### Scenario: An identity mesh is a no-op

- **WHEN** `transform_layer_warp` is called with `identity_mesh` over the source rect and zero distortion
- **THEN** it returns true and the layer rect and every plane are unchanged

#### Scenario: An interior control point deforms the interior

- **WHEN** an interior control point of a 4×4 identity mesh is moved and the op runs
- **THEN** the layer rect grows to the deformed bounding box and the four corner pixels are unchanged

#### Scenario: Degenerate meshes are refused

- **WHEN** a mesh point is non-finite, `rows` or `cols` is below 2, or the point count does not equal `rows·cols`
- **THEN** the op returns false and every field of `doc` equals its pre-call value

#### Scenario: Out-of-source pixels are transparent

- **WHEN** the mesh pulls part of the destination outside the source rect
- **THEN** every such destination pixel has all channels equal to `0`
