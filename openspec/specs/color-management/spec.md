# color-management Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m3-color-management. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Built-in working-space profiles are generated at runtime

The `pictura-color` crate SHALL provide built-in sRGB (IEC 61966-2.1), Adobe RGB
(1998), and ProPhoto RGB (ROMM RGB) profiles. These MUST be synthesized
programmatically from their white point, primaries, and tone curve at runtime;
the crate MUST NOT depend on bundled Adobe or third-party ICC profile files.

#### Scenario: sRGB built-in is valid

- **WHEN** `Profile::srgb()` is called
- **THEN** it returns a usable RGB profile with the sRGB color space signature

#### Scenario: Adobe RGB primaries

- **WHEN** `Profile::adobe_rgb()` is called
- **THEN** it returns a valid RGB profile built from the Adobe RGB (1998)
  primaries (D65 white, red 0.6400/0.3300, green 0.2100/0.7100, blue
  0.1500/0.0600) and gamma 563/256

#### Scenario: ProPhoto primaries

- **WHEN** `Profile::pro_photo()` is called
- **THEN** it returns a valid RGB profile built from the ROMM primaries (D50
  white, red 0.7347/0.2653, green 0.1596/0.8404, blue 0.0366/0.0001) with the
  ROMM tone curve

### Requirement: ICC profiles load from and serialize to bytes

The crate SHALL load an ICC profile from raw bytes via `Profile::from_icc` and
SHALL serialize a profile back to ICC bytes via `Profile::to_icc`. A profile
serialized by `to_icc` MUST reload through `from_icc` with the same color space
signature.

#### Scenario: Built-in profiles round-trip

- **WHEN** `to_icc()` is called on a built-in profile and the result is passed to
  `from_icc()`
- **THEN** the reloaded profile has the same color space signature as the original

#### Scenario: Empty serialization is avoided

- **WHEN** `to_icc()` is called on a valid profile
- **THEN** the returned byte vector is non-empty

### Requirement: Assign retags a profile without changing pixels

The `assign` operation SHALL return the input pixel buffer unchanged together
with the destination profile. It MUST NOT build a transform or alter any sample;
assignment only reinterprets the numeric values under a new tag.

#### Scenario: Pixels are byte-identical after assign

- **WHEN** an image buffer is assigned a new profile
- **THEN** the returned buffer equals the input buffer byte-for-byte and the
  returned profile is the assigned profile in the RGB color space

### Requirement: Convert transforms pixels between profiles

The `convert` function SHALL build a source-to-destination transform and apply it
per pixel, returning a buffer with the same channel count and bit depth as the
input. It SHALL error when the declared dimensions, channel count, and bit depth
do not match the input buffer length. For RGBA input the alpha channel MUST be
copied through unchanged.

#### Scenario: Output shape matches input

- **WHEN** `convert` is called on a well-formed buffer
- **THEN** the returned buffer has the same length and layout as the input buffer

#### Scenario: Length mismatch is an error

- **WHEN** the input buffer length does not equal
  `width × height × channels × (bits / 8)`
- **THEN** `convert` returns a `ColorError::Unsupported` error rather than
  reading out of bounds

#### Scenario: Alpha channel is preserved

- **WHEN** 4-channel RGBA input is converted between two profiles
- **THEN** every alpha byte in the output equals the corresponding input alpha
  byte

### Requirement: Rendering intents and black point compensation are accepted

`convert` SHALL accept all four ICC rendering intents — Perceptual, Relative
Colorimetric, Saturation, and Absolute Colorimetric — and a black point
compensation flag. Each intent MUST produce non-degenerate output, and enabling
black point compensation MUST set the Little CMS black-point-compensation flag.

#### Scenario: Every intent runs

- **WHEN** a conversion is run once per rendering intent
- **THEN** each run returns an output of the expected length with more than eight
  distinct pixel values

#### Scenario: Black point compensation is forwarded

- **WHEN** black point compensation is enabled
- **THEN** the transform is built with the black-point-compensation flag set

### Requirement: Bit depths and channel counts

`convert` SHALL support 8-bit and 16-bit samples and 1-, 3-, and 4-channel
interleaved input (gray, RGB, and RGBA respectively), mapping gray/RGB/RGBA input
into the destination color space. Any other channel-count/bit-depth combination
MUST return a `ColorError::Unsupported`.

#### Scenario: 16-bit input is preserved at 16-bit

- **WHEN** a 16-bit RGB buffer is converted
- **THEN** the output is the same number of 16-bit samples as the input

#### Scenario: Unsupported format is rejected

- **WHEN** `convert` is called with e.g. 2 channels or 12 bits
- **THEN** it returns a `ColorError::Unsupported`

### Requirement: Identity conversion is a no-op

Converting a profile to itself SHALL leave every sample within ±1 LSB of the
input, at both 8-bit and 16-bit depths.

#### Scenario: 8-bit identity

- **WHEN** an 8-bit image is converted from sRGB to sRGB
- **THEN** every output sample differs from its input by at most 1

#### Scenario: 16-bit identity

- **WHEN** a 16-bit image is converted from sRGB to sRGB
- **THEN** every output sample differs from its input by at most 1

### Requirement: Malformed ICC input returns an error, never panics

`Profile::from_icc` SHALL return `ColorError::InvalidProfile` for empty,
truncated, or non-ICC byte input. It MUST NOT panic on any byte sequence.

#### Scenario: Empty and garbage input

- **WHEN** `from_icc` is called with an empty slice, 128 zero bytes, or arbitrary
  non-ICC text
- **THEN** it returns an `Err` and does not panic

### Requirement: ImageMagick differential oracle within tolerance

The change SHALL include an independent ImageMagick oracle
(`scripts/color_oracle.py`) that runs
`magick … -profile SRC.icc -profile DST.icc` and a differential test comparing
`pictura_color::convert` against it. The differential and known-value tests MUST
accept a per-sample tolerance of 3 (8-bit LSB); differences beyond that MUST fail
the test. The oracle tests MAY skip when ImageMagick or the system ICC profiles
are unavailable.

#### Scenario: sRGB to Adobe RGB matches ImageMagick

- **WHEN** the differential test converts the fixture sRGB → Adobe RGB
  (relative colorimetric, black point compensation on) and ImageMagick is present
- **THEN** no 8-bit sample differs by more than 3 from the ImageMagick output

#### Scenario: Known sRGB primaries

- **WHEN** the sRGB primaries are converted to Adobe RGB with relative
  colorimetric and black point compensation
- **THEN** pure red, green, and blue land within 3 LSB of (219, 2, 0),
  (144, 255, 60), and (0, 2, 250) respectively, and black/white/gray are preserved

#### Scenario: Oracle skips cleanly without ImageMagick

- **WHEN** the `magick` binary is not on `PATH`
- **THEN** the oracle-dependent tests report a skip and do not fail
