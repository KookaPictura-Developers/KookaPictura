# psd-color-modes Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change color-mode-read. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Non-RGB color modes open by normalizing to the working mode

`read_psd` SHALL accept header color modes Bitmap (0), Grayscale (1), Indexed
(2), RGB (3), CMYK (4), Multichannel (7), Duotone (8), and Lab (9). It SHALL convert a non-RGB mode's color
planes into the engine's working mode (RGB for Bitmap/Indexed/CMYK/Lab,
Grayscale unchanged) and SHALL set the returned document's `mode` to `Rgb` or
`Grayscale` and its `depth` to `Eight`. A header color mode of Duotone (8) or
Multichannel (7) with header channel count 1 or 3 at depth 8 SHALL open by
normalizing to the working mode (Duotone and 1-channel Multichannel as
grayscale; 3-channel Multichannel as profile-free CMY→RGB). Multichannel with
any other channel count, any other mode code, and any bit depth other than 8
(other than depth 1 for Bitmap, and depths 16/32 for the Grayscale/RGB/CMYK/Lab
modes read per `psd-bit-depth`) SHALL return `PsdError::Unsupported`. A header
channel count below the mode's color-channel count SHALL return
`PsdError::Invalid`.

#### Scenario: An Indexed document opens as RGB with palette colors

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Indexed PSD whose indices select distinct palette entries is read
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns a document whose `mode` is `Rgb` and whose composite pixels are the palette colors for those indices

#### Scenario: A CMYK document opens as RGB

- **WHEN** an 8-bit CMYK PSD is read
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns a document whose `mode` is `Rgb`, whose `depth` is `Eight`, and whose composite is the profile-free CMYK-to-RGB conversion of the stored planes

#### Scenario: A Lab document opens as RGB

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab PSD is read
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns a document whose `mode` is `Rgb` and whose composite is the profile-free CIELAB-to-sRGB conversion of the stored planes

#### Scenario: A Bitmap document opens as black and white RGB

- **WHEN** a depth-1 Bitmap PSD is read
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns an RGB document whose pixels are black where the bit is set and white where it is clear

#### Scenario: Grayscale and RGB are unchanged

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Grayscale or RGB PSD is read
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns a document whose mode is `Grayscale` or `Rgb` respectively, exactly as before this change

#### Scenario: Duotone opens as grayscale-normalized RGB

- **WHEN** the header color mode is Duotone (8) at depth 8 with one channel
- **THEN** `read_psd` succeeds, `mode` is `Rgb`, `source_mode` is `Some(Duotone)`,
  and `color_mode_data` is preserved

#### Scenario: One-channel Multichannel opens as grayscale-normalized RGB

- **WHEN** the header color mode is Multichannel (7) at depth 8 with header channel count 1
- **THEN** `read_psd` succeeds and normalizes like grayscale with `source_mode` `Some(Multichannel)`

#### Scenario: Three-channel Multichannel opens as CMY-normalized RGB

- **WHEN** the header color mode is Multichannel (7) at depth 8 with header channel count 3
- **THEN** `read_psd` succeeds and the composite is the profile-free CMY→RGB map of the three plates with `source_mode` `Some(Multichannel)`

#### Scenario: Other Multichannel channel counts stay unsupported

- **WHEN** the header color mode is Multichannel (7) with channel count not in {1, 3}
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns `PsdError::Unsupported` and does not panic

#### Scenario: Unknown mode codes stay unsupported

- **WHEN** the header color mode is any code other than 0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns `PsdError::Unsupported` and does not panic

#### Scenario: Depth 16 and 32 are normalized with the mode

- **WHEN** a 16- or 32-bit CMYK or Lab document is read
- **THEN** the samples are narrowed to 8-bit and the color planes are converted to the working mode per this requirement and `psd-bit-depth`

### Requirement: Bitmap mode is read as MSB-first 1-bit rows

For a Bitmap-mode document at depth 1, `read_psd` SHALL read each row as
`ceil(width / 8)` bytes, most-significant bit first, where pixel `x` is bit
`0x80 >> (x % 8)`, a set bit SHALL decode to black (0) and a clear bit to white
(255), and each row SHALL be padded to a byte boundary. Compression `0` (raw)
and `1` (PackBits RLE) SHALL be supported at depth 1; compression `2` or `3`
SHALL return `PsdError::Unsupported`.

#### Scenario: A set bit is black and a clear bit is white

- **WHEN** a Bitmap row byte is `0xAA` for an 8-pixel-wide row
- **THEN** the decoded row is black, white, black, white, black, white, black, white

#### Scenario: Rows are byte-padded and independently encoded

- **WHEN** a Bitmap document is wider than a multiple of 8 and uses RLE compression
- **THEN** each scanline's RLE decode writes exactly `ceil(width / 8)` bytes into the row

#### Scenario: A Bitmap layer channel is bit-expanded

- **WHEN** a depth-1 Bitmap document carries a layer whose color channel is bit-packed
- **THEN** that layer's color channel is expanded to 8-bit black/white pixels and becomes three RGB channels, not decoded at an 8-bit row stride

#### Scenario: ZIP compression at depth 1 is unsupported

- **WHEN** a depth-1 Bitmap document declares compression 2 or 3
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns `PsdError::Unsupported`

### Requirement: Indexed mode maps pixel indices through the 768-byte palette

For an Indexed-mode document, the color-mode-data section SHALL be read as a
768-byte palette laid out as 256 red bytes, then 256 green bytes, then 256 blue
bytes, and a composite pixel whose stored index is `i` SHALL decode to
`(palette[i], palette[256 + i], palette[512 + i])`. A color-mode-data section
whose length is not 768 SHALL return `PsdError::Invalid`, never a panic.

#### Scenario: An index selects its palette color

- **WHEN** an Indexed pixel stores index `i` and the palette has red at byte `i`, green at byte `256 + i`, and blue at `512 + i`
- **THEN** the decoded pixel is that palette RGB color

#### Scenario: A malformed palette is rejected

- **WHEN** an Indexed document's color-mode-data section is shorter or longer than 768 bytes
- **THEN** `read_psd` returns `PsdError::Invalid`

### Requirement: CMYK and Lab use documented profile-free approximations

The CMYK conversion SHALL compute each RGB channel as `floor(stored_color *
stored_black / 255)` from the stored cyan, magenta, yellow, and black planes,
where a stored value of 0 is full ink and 255 is no ink. The Lab conversion
SHALL treat the three planes as `L* = L * 100 / 255`, `a* = a - 128`, and
`b* = b - 128` and convert CIELAB under D50 to sRGB through a Bradford D50-to-D65
adaptation. Both conversions SHALL be profile-free: the document's embedded ICC
profile SHALL NOT be applied and no Photoshop pixel parity SHALL be claimed.

#### Scenario: CMYK uses the integer formula

- **WHEN** a CMYK pixel stores `(C, M, Y, K) = (128, 64, 32, 200)`
- **THEN** the decoded RGB pixel is `(100, 50, 25)`

#### Scenario: CMYK full black and full white

- **WHEN** a CMYK pixel stores `(0, 0, 0, 0)` or `(255, 255, 255, 255)`
- **THEN** the decoded RGB pixel is `(0, 0, 0)` or `(255, 255, 255)` respectively

#### Scenario: Lab neutral gray and white

- **WHEN** a Lab pixel stores `(200, 128, 128)` or `(255, 128, 128)`
- **THEN** the decoded RGB pixel is a neutral gray near `(194, 194, 194)` or white near `(255, 255, 255)`, within 2 per channel

#### Scenario: An embedded profile is ignored

- **WHEN** a CMYK document carries an embedded ICC profile
- **THEN** the decoded RGB values use the profile-free formula and do not depend on the profile bytes

### Requirement: Layer color planes are converted with the document

When a non-RGB document carries layers, `read_psd` SHALL convert each layer's
color channels with the same conversion as the composite, replacing them with
the working mode's color planes while leaving every non-color channel (`-1`
transparency, `-2` mask, and unmodeled channels) unchanged. A layer whose color
channels do not match the mode's channel layout SHALL be left unchanged rather
than producing a wrong conversion.

#### Scenario: A CMYK layer becomes RGB

- **WHEN** a CMYK document carries a pixel layer with four color channels
- **THEN** the returned layer carries three RGB color channels that are the profile-free conversion of the stored CMYK planes, and its transparency channel is unchanged

#### Scenario: Alpha and mask channels are untouched

- **WHEN** a non-RGB layer carries a `-1` transparency channel and a `-2` mask channel
- **THEN** those channels' bytes are the same as in the file

### Requirement: The application reports a normalized color mode

The application SHALL expose the source color mode of an opened document and
SHALL present a conversion notice to the user when a non-RGB file is normalized,
so the user knows how the document is edited and what a save writes. For an
**8-bit** Lab or CMYK document the notice SHALL indicate that a save preserves
that mode (a 16/32-bit Lab or CMYK document writes RGB like any other converted
mode); for a Bitmap or Indexed document it SHALL indicate that a save writes the
working (RGB) mode. Document creation SHALL continue to offer only RGB and
Grayscale.

#### Scenario: Opening a Lab file shows a preserving notice

- **WHEN** the application opens an 8-bit Lab PSD
- **THEN** the view reports that the document was converted from Lab and that a save preserves Lab

#### Scenario: Opening a CMYK file shows a preserving notice

- **WHEN** the application opens an 8-bit CMYK PSD
- **THEN** the view reports that the document was converted from CMYK and that a save preserves CMYK

#### Scenario: Opening a 16-bit Lab or CMYK file shows an RGB-save notice

- **WHEN** the application opens a 16-bit Lab or CMYK PSD
- **THEN** the view reports the conversion and does not claim the save preserves the source mode

#### Scenario: Opening an RGB file shows no notice

- **WHEN** the application opens an RGB or Grayscale PSD
- **THEN** no conversion notice is shown

### Requirement: Color-mode fixtures agree with an independent decoder

The system SHALL commit the fixtures
`crates/pictura-codec/tests/fixtures/indexed.psd`, `cmyk.psd`, `lab.psd`, and
`bitmap.psd`, regenerated byte-stably by `scripts/generate-fixtures.py`, and a
test SHALL verify that `read_psd`'s decoded pixels agree with the independent
`psd-tools` decoder for the Indexed, CMYK, and Bitmap fixtures (CMYK within the
documented 1-LSB rounding), with the exact lcms2 LAB-to-sRGB transform for the
Lab fixture (within the documented 1-LSB tolerance; psd-tools' optimized
`.convert("RGB")` composite SHALL NOT be the reference), and with a hand-built
Bitmap RLE file. The oracle SHALL self-skip with a clear message when `psd-tools`
is unavailable and SHALL NOT fail the suite in that case.

#### Scenario: Indexed fixture agrees with psd-tools

- **WHEN** `read_psd` decodes `indexed.psd` and `psd-tools` decodes the same file
- **THEN** the RGB pixels are identical

#### Scenario: CMYK fixture agrees with psd-tools

- **WHEN** `read_psd` decodes `cmyk.psd` and `psd-tools` decodes the same file
- **THEN** every RGB channel differs by at most 1 (the engine floors the profile-free formula, Pillow rounds it)

#### Scenario: Lab fixture agrees with the exact lcms2 transform

- **WHEN** `read_psd` decodes `lab.psd` and lcms2's exact (unoptimized) LAB-to-sRGB transform decodes the same file's Lab composite
- **THEN** every RGB channel differs by at most 1

#### Scenario: The Bitmap RLE file decodes against its own bytes

- **WHEN** a hand-built depth-1 Bitmap file with RLE compression is read
- **THEN** the decoded pixels equal the hand-computed black/white pattern

#### Scenario: The oracle self-skips without psd-tools

- **WHEN** the `psd-tools` package is not available
- **THEN** the oracle reports a skip and the suite passes

### Requirement: A normalized document records its source mode and saves in it when the mode maps back

When `read_psd` normalizes a non-RGB mode, it SHALL set
`Document.source_mode` to `Some(header_mode)` and SHALL set it to `None` for a
Grayscale or RGB file and for a constructed document. It SHALL convert every
color plane of the document, the composite and each layer, recursing into a
group's descendant layers so a nested pixel layer is converted like a top-level
one. It SHALL drop the Indexed palette from `Document.color_mode_data` on the
normalized document and SHALL instead retain that palette (and each Indexed
index plane, the composite's and every layer's) in the source store, so an
unchanged Indexed document can be written back.

`write_psd` SHALL write a document whose `source_mode` is `Lab` or `Cmyk` back
with that header color mode and, when the read retained native samples, at that
source depth, preferring the source color planes the read retained: it SHALL
re-emit a plane — the composite's or every layer's color channels —
byte-identically at the source depth when the plane is unchanged, and SHALL
otherwise convert it from the working RGB with a profile-free inverse of the
read-side conversion for that mode (8-bit, widened to the source depth when it is
16/32). The Lab inverse quantizes; the CMYK inverse (`rgb_to_cmyk`) SHALL be an
exact right-inverse of `cmyk_to_rgb` so an edited CMYK pixel reads back to the
edited RGB. Each such conversion SHALL be documented as an approximation for an
edited plane (the read is profile-free) and SHALL NOT claim Photoshop
color-management parity.

`write_psd` SHALL write an Indexed document back with header color mode Indexed
(one index channel and the retained palette) when its `source_mode` is `Indexed`
and every retained index plane — the composite's when a merged composite is
present, and every pixel layer's — still forward-converts through the palette to
the current working RGB; otherwise it SHALL write the working mode. It SHALL NOT
invent an RGB-to-palette quantization for an edited document.

`write_psd` SHALL write a flat, unchanged Bitmap document back with header color
mode Bitmap (mode 0, depth 1, one 1-bit channel) at its source compression,
re-emitting the retained packed plane byte-identically, when its `source_mode` is
`Bitmap`, it carries no layers or extra channels, and the retained packed plane
still expands to the working RGB. A Bitmap document that has been edited, or that
carries layers or extra channels, SHALL write the working mode; no RGB-to-1-bit
threshold SHALL be invented, and layered or extra-channel Bitmap write-back is
out of scope.

`write_psd` SHALL write an 8-bit Duotone document back with header color mode
8 when its `source_mode` is `Duotone`, it is flat and unedited, and the retained
plane still converts to the working RGB; it SHALL re-emit `color_mode_data`
unchanged. `write_psd` SHALL write an 8-bit Multichannel document back with
header color mode 7 when its `source_mode` is `Multichannel`, its header channel
count was 1 or 3, it is flat and unedited, and the retained plates still convert
to the working RGB. An edited or layered Duotone/Multichannel document SHALL
write the working mode; no plate layout or duotone curve SHALL be invented.

It SHALL re-emit the preserved color-mode-data and image-resource sections. For
a document with no source mode it SHALL continue to write the working mode.

#### Scenario: A Lab document saves as Lab

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab document is read and written
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is Lab and an independent decoder's RGB conversion of the output agrees with the input composite within the documented tolerance

#### Scenario: A CMYK document saves as CMYK

- **WHEN** an 8-bit CMYK document is read and written
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is CMYK with four color channels, the unedited color planes are byte-identical to the source, and the output agrees with an independent decoder

#### Scenario: An unedited Lab document saves losslessly

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab document is read and written without an edit
- **THEN** the output's Lab planes are byte-identical to the input's and a re-read's working RGB equals the original

#### Scenario: An unedited CMYK document saves losslessly

- **WHEN** an 8-bit CMYK document is read and written without an edit
- **THEN** the output's CMYK color planes are byte-identical to the input's and a re-read agrees with the original working RGB

#### Scenario: An edited Lab plane is re-encoded approximately

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab document's composite is edited and written
- **THEN** the changed plane is re-encoded from the edited working RGB with the profile-free inverse, which the spec documents as approximate for saturated colors

#### Scenario: An edited CMYK plane uses the exact inverse

- **WHEN** an 8-bit CMYK document's color plane is edited and written
- **THEN** reading the output back yields exactly the edited RGB bytes

#### Scenario: A Lab layer channel is converted

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab document with a pixel layer is written
- **THEN** the layer's color channels are Lab-encoded and read back to the same RGB pixels within tolerance

#### Scenario: A CMYK layer channel is converted

- **WHEN** an 8-bit CMYK document with a pixel layer is written
- **THEN** the layer carries four CMYK color channels and reads back to the same RGB pixels within the documented tolerance

#### Scenario: A grouped Lab layer is converted

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Lab document has a pixel layer nested in a group
- **THEN** the nested layer's color channels are converted to RGB on read, like a top-level layer, and the save→read round trip keeps the same pixels

#### Scenario: A 16/32-bit Lab or CMYK source saves back in its source mode and depth

- **WHEN** a 16/32-bit Lab or CMYK document is read and written unchanged
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is Lab or CMYK and its header depth is the source depth, and the retained native color planes are byte-identical to the input's

#### Scenario: Source mode is recorded

- **WHEN** a CMYK or Lab file is read
- **THEN** the document's `mode` is `Rgb` and its `source_mode` is `Some(ColorMode::Cmyk)` or `Some(ColorMode::Lab)`

#### Scenario: Native modes record no source mode

- **WHEN** an RGB or Grayscale file is read, or a document is constructed
- **THEN** its `source_mode` is `None`

#### Scenario: The Indexed palette is consumed

- **WHEN** an Indexed file is read
- **THEN** the returned document's `color_mode_data` is empty

#### Scenario: A flat unchanged Bitmap document saves as Bitmap

- **WHEN** a flat depth-1 Bitmap file with no layers or extra channels is read and written without an edit
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is Bitmap with depth 1 and one color channel, its packed plane is byte-identical to the input's, and a re-read's working RGB equals the original

#### Scenario: An edited or layered Bitmap document saves as the working mode

- **WHEN** a Bitmap document's composite is edited, or the document carries a pixel layer or an extra channel, and it is written
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is RGB and the round-tripped document's `mode` is `Rgb`, because no RGB-to-1-bit threshold is invented and layered/extra-channel Bitmap output is out of scope

#### Scenario: An unchanged Indexed document saves back as Indexed

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Indexed document is read and written without an edit
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is Indexed with one color channel, its palette is byte-identical to the input's, its index planes are byte-identical to the input's, and a re-read's working RGB equals the original

#### Scenario: An edited Indexed document saves as the working mode

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Indexed document's composite or a pixel layer is edited and written
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is RGB and the round-tripped document's `mode` is `Rgb`, because no RGB-to-palette quantization is invented

#### Scenario: An Indexed layer and its group are retained

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Indexed document has a pixel layer nested in a group and is written unchanged
- **THEN** the nested layer's index channel and the composite are re-emitted byte-identically and a re-read matches the original pixels

#### Scenario: An Indexed document without a merged composite saves back as Indexed

- **WHEN** an 8-bit Indexed document with no merged composite and an unchanged pixel layer is written
- **THEN** the output's header color mode is Indexed with one index channel, its palette is byte-identical to the input's, its layer index channel is byte-identical, and no image-data section is written

#### Scenario: An unchanged Duotone document saves as Duotone

- **WHEN** a flat Duotone document is opened and written without edits
- **THEN** the header color mode is 8, `color_mode_data` matches the input, and the plane bytes match the retained source

#### Scenario: An edited Duotone document saves as RGB

- **WHEN** a Duotone document's composite is edited before save
- **THEN** the header color mode is RGB

#### Scenario: An unchanged one-channel Multichannel document saves as Multichannel

- **WHEN** a flat 1-channel Multichannel document is opened and written without edits
- **THEN** the header color mode is 7 and the plate bytes match the retained source

#### Scenario: An unchanged three-channel Multichannel document saves as Multichannel

- **WHEN** a flat 3-channel Multichannel document is opened and written without edits
- **THEN** the header color mode is 7 and the three plate bytes match the retained source

#### Scenario: An edited Multichannel document saves as RGB

- **WHEN** a Multichannel document's composite is edited before save
- **THEN** the header color mode is RGB

### Requirement: Duotone color-mode data is decoded

The system SHALL provide
`pictura_codec::duotone::parse_duotone(data: &[u8]) -> Option<DuotoneSpec>`
decoding the PSD Duotone Options block (the color-mode-data section of a Duotone
document) into a typed view: a `version`, a plate count, up to four `DuotoneInk`
records (each an ink color, a Pascal-string name, a 13-point transfer curve with
`-1` sentinels preserved, and an override flag), the dot-gain value, and the
overprint colors. The parser SHALL return `None` when the block is shorter than
524 bytes or the plate count is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, and MUST NOT panic. The
document open path, the grayscale normalization, and the opaque write-back SHALL
be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A two-plate spec parses

- **WHEN** a 524-byte Duotone Options block with plate count 2 and known ink colors, names, curves, dot gain, and one overprint color is parsed
- **THEN** `parse_duotone` returns a spec with those values and two inks

#### Scenario: A short or invalid block is rejected

- **WHEN** the block is shorter than 524 bytes, or its plate count is 0 or 5
- **THEN** `parse_duotone` returns `None` and does not panic

#### Scenario: The open path is unchanged

- **WHEN** a Duotone document is read
- **THEN** it still opens as grayscale-normalized RGB with `source_mode` `Duotone` and its color-mode data preserved
