# psd-image-resources Specification

## Purpose
Decodes and re-encodes PSD image-resource blocks into typed records via the shared codec reader.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Image resources are decoded into typed records

`pictura-codec` SHALL expose `decode_image_resources(document: &Document) ->
Vec<ImageResource>` that parses the document's preserved image-resource section
into typed records in stored order. Each record SHALL carry the resource `id`
(`u16`), its `name` (the Pascal string with the length byte removed and a
trailing NUL stripped, decoded lossily as text), its `data` bytes verbatim, and
the `raw` bytes of the whole block so it can be re-emitted. A block SHALL be
read as a 4-byte signature, a `u16` id, a Pascal name padded to an even length, a
`u32` data length, and that many data bytes padded to an even length. The
signatures `8BIM`, `8B64`, `MeSa`, `AgHg`, `PHUT`, and `DCSR` SHALL be accepted;
any other signature, a truncated block, or trailing bytes too short to frame a
block SHALL end parsing and the records decoded so far SHALL be returned. The
parser SHALL NOT panic and SHALL NOT allocate without bound on a malformed
section. When the section is written, `write_psd` SHALL reproduce it
byte-for-byte except that a resource `1039` the parser framed whose ICC
data-space signature does not match the output header color mode SHALL be
dropped.

#### Scenario: A resource section decodes to typed records

- **WHEN** the document carries an image-resource section holding an EXIF resource and an XMP packet
- **THEN** `decode_image_resources` returns records carrying those ids, names, exact data bytes, and raw block bytes in stored order

#### Scenario: The ICC profile is exposed by id

- **WHEN** the decoded records include resource id `1039`
- **THEN** the record's `data` is the embedded ICC profile bytes and the well-known id constant equals `1039`

#### Scenario: A malformed block is skipped without panicking

- **WHEN** the section ends with a truncated block or an unrecognized signature
- **THEN** `decode_image_resources` returns the records decoded before it and does not panic

#### Scenario: Byte preservation is unchanged for unnormalized documents

- **WHEN** a document read from a file with a non-empty image-resource section that was not ICC-normalized is written back
- **THEN** the output's image-resource bytes are identical to the input's, except that a resource `1039` whose ICC data-space signature does not match the output header color mode is dropped

### Requirement: Image-resource data is parsed with the shared codec reader

The image-resource parser SHALL use the existing bounds-checked `pictura-codec`
`Reader`, so every read is length-checked and a truncated section yields a
recoverable end-of-parse rather than an index panic. It SHALL NOT introduce a
second byte cursor.

#### Scenario: Truncation is recoverable

- **WHEN** a resource block's declared data length exceeds the remaining bytes
- **THEN** parsing stops, the prior records are returned, and no panic occurs

### Requirement: Image resources are re-encoded from typed records

`pictura-codec` SHALL expose `encode_image_resources(resources: &[ImageResource])
-> Vec<u8>` that concatenates each record's raw block bytes in order, so that
`encode_image_resources(&decode_image_resources(doc))` reproduces the document's
image-resource section byte-for-byte. `ImageResource` SHALL carry the raw block
bytes it was decoded from.

#### Scenario: Decode then encode is byte-identical

- **WHEN** any committed fixture's image-resource section is decoded and re-encoded
- **THEN** the output equals the original section bytes

### Requirement: An image-resource block is framed from typed fields

`pictura-codec` SHALL expose `frame_image_resource(id: u16, name: &str, data:
&[u8]) -> ImageResource` that produces a block's `raw` bytes as a 4-byte `8BIM`
signature, the big-endian `u16` id, a Pascal name padded to an even length, the
big-endian `u32` data length, and the data padded to an even length, and that
sets the record's `id`, `name`, and `data`. A name longer than 255 bytes SHALL be
truncated to 255 bytes (the Pascal length is a `u8`), and the record's `name`
SHALL be the truncated form. Framing a record and then decoding the resulting
block SHALL recover the same `id`, `name`, and `data`.

#### Scenario: A framed odd-length value round-trips

- **WHEN** a record is framed from an id, a name, and odd-length data and the resulting block is decoded
- **THEN** the decoded record has the same id, name, and data

#### Scenario: A long name is truncated to the length byte

- **WHEN** a record is framed with a 300-byte name
- **THEN** framing and decoding recover the first 255 bytes as the name
