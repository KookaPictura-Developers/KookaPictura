# type-live-composite Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change type-live-composite. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: A proxy-less type layer renders live in the compositor

The CPU compositor SHALL render a non-group layer that carries a `TypeTool` and
has no colour channel by shaping and rasterizing its text with the bundled
backend and compositing the result over the layer's canvas-clipped region with
the layer's opacity, mask, and blend mode, instead of painting the channel-less
rect. A type layer that carries a colour channel SHALL still composite from that
raster.

#### Scenario: Proxy-less type renders coverage

- **WHEN** a document has a type layer with a style and no colour channel
- **THEN** its region composites non-empty text coverage rather than an opaque black rect

#### Scenario: A stored proxy is unchanged

- **WHEN** a type layer carries a colour channel
- **THEN** the compositor uses the channel and the live renderer is not invoked for it

### Requirement: The GPU declines a proxy-less type layer

The GPU compositor SHALL report a text-unsupported error for a stack containing
a type layer with no colour channel, so the CPU oracle composites it. A stack
with no such layer SHALL keep using the GPU path.

#### Scenario: A proxy-less type layer forces the CPU oracle

- **WHEN** a document contains a type layer with no colour channel
- **THEN** the GPU compositor declines and the CPU composite is the result
