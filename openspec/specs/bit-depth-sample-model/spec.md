# bit-depth-sample-model Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change bit-depth-sample-model. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: PixelBuffer is sample-typed with an 8-bit default

The engine's planar image buffer SHALL be generic over its sample type with `u8`
as the default, so a bare `PixelBuffer` denotes `PixelBuffer<u8>`, its `data`
field holds `Vec<u8>`, and existing 8-bit indexing is unchanged. The buffer
SHALL support at least the `u8`, `u16`, and `f32` sample types, keeping the
planar layout `data.len() == width * height * channels`.

#### Scenario: A bare PixelBuffer is 8-bit

- **WHEN** code constructs `PixelBuffer::new(2, 2, 3)` and reads `data`
- **THEN** the value is a `Vec<u8>` of length 12 and the type is `PixelBuffer<u8>`

#### Scenario: A wider sample buffer is expressible

- **WHEN** code constructs a `PixelBuffer<u16>` of width 2, height 2, and 3 channels
- **THEN** its `data` is a `Vec<u16>` of length 12

### Requirement: Retained source samples are stored as typed samples

The codec SHALL store its retained native samples as decoded typed samples of the
document's bit depth rather than as the PSD byte image. The composite and
document-extra store `SourcePlanes` SHALL hold `u8` at the 8-bit Lab store, `u16`
at depth 16, and `f32` at depth 32, with the width and height it was decoded for.
The per-layer store `SourceChannels` SHALL hold the same typed samples with the
layer rect and channel ids it was decoded for. The read path SHALL decode the PSD
byte image into these samples and the write path SHALL re-encode them.

#### Scenario: A depth-16 read retains u16 samples

- **WHEN** a depth-16 RGB PSD is read
- **THEN** `Document.source_planes` holds `u16` samples of the composite color
  channels and document extra channels, not the big-endian byte image

#### Scenario: A depth-32 read retains f32 samples

- **WHEN** a depth-32 RGB PSD is read
- **THEN** `Document.source_planes` holds `f32` samples of the composite color
  channels and document extra channels

#### Scenario: A depth-16 layer retains u16 channel samples

- **WHEN** a depth-16 document carries a layer
- **THEN** the layer's `source_channels` store holds `u16` samples keyed by
  channel id

### Requirement: Sample conversions follow the depth rules

The model SHALL expose one conversion for narrowing a native sample to 8-bit
and one for widening an 8-bit sample to the native depth, and these SHALL be the
single implementation used by the codec. Narrowing SHALL be `sample >> 8` at
depth 16 and `clamp(trunc(sample * 256), 0, 255)` at depth 32. Widening SHALL be
`v * 257` at depth 16 and the 8-bit value scaled to `[0, 1]` at depth 32.

#### Scenario: Narrowing matches the byte rule

- **WHEN** the converters narrow a 16-bit `0`, `255`, `256`, `32768`, `65535`
- **THEN** the results are `0`, `0`, `1`, `128`, `255` and narrowing a 32-bit
  `1.5` or `-0.5` yields `255` or `0`

#### Scenario: Widening matches the byte rule

- **WHEN** the converters widen the 8-bit `0`, `1`, `255` to 16-bit
- **THEN** the results are `0`, `257`, `65535`, and widening to 32-bit yields
  `0.0`, `1.0/255.0`, `1.0`

### Requirement: The typed store round-trips the source bytes exactly

For an unedited 16/32-bit document the write path SHALL encode the retained
typed samples back to the same bytes the read path decoded (byte-identical for
big-endian `u16` and IEEE-754 big-endian `f32`), so the existing source-depth
round-trip and its `psd-tools` oracle are unchanged. An edited plane SHALL
continue to be widened from its 8-bit bytes as before.

#### Scenario: Encode inverts decode

- **WHEN** an arbitrary native sample image is decoded to samples and re-encoded
- **THEN** the bytes are identical to the input for both depth 16 and depth 32

#### Scenario: The depth oracle is unchanged

- **WHEN** the existing depth and color-mode oracles run after this change
- **THEN** they pass with no golden change
