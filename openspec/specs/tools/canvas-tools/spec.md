# canvas-tools Specification

## Purpose
Move, Crop, Eyedropper, Hand, and Zoom tools for navigating and editing the canvas.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Move tool translates the active layer
The system SHALL translate the topmost pixel layer of the active document by a
dragged offset, recompositing the document. Group and adjustment layers SHALL be
ignored, and an empty or absent document SHALL be a no-op. A layer whose lock
state includes the position lock SHALL be refused, and the refusal SHALL leave
the document unchanged with no history state.

#### Scenario: Drag moves the layer content
- **WHEN** the Move tool is dragged by a delta and the active document has a pixel layer
- **THEN** that layer's content is translated by the delta and the composite updates

#### Scenario: No pixel layer
- **WHEN** the Move tool is dragged and the document has no pixel layer
- **THEN** nothing changes and the document is not corrupted

#### Scenario: A position-locked layer is refused [lct_move_locked]
- **WHEN** the Move tool is dragged and the topmost pixel layer is position-locked
- **THEN** the layer does not move, the composite is unchanged, and no history
  state is added

### Requirement: Crop tool
The system SHALL place a crop box over the whole canvas when the Crop tool is
chosen (fitted to the aspect ratio when one is set), shading the area outside
it and drawing rule-of-thirds guides, its frame, and eight handles. Dragging a
handle SHALL resize the box (keeping the aspect ratio when one is set), dragging
inside SHALL move it, and dragging outside SHALL draw a new box, with the
matching move/resize cursor over each part. Enter, a double-click inside the
box, or the options bar's Apply SHALL crop the document to the box as one
"Crop" state; Escape or the options bar's Cancel SHALL reset the box to the
canvas. The options bar SHALL offer aspect-ratio presets (Unconstrained, 1:1,
4:5, 5:7, 2:3, 16:9) and Delete Cropped Pixels (on by default): when on, each
pixel layer's pixels and mask outside the new canvas SHALL be discarded (layers
with live type, smart objects, vector masks, or retained 16/32-bit samples keep
theirs); when off they SHALL be kept beyond the canvas edge. A crop SHALL be
pending only while the tool is active and the box differs from the canvas. The
system SHALL also expose `Image > Crop`, which commits a pending crop or else
crops to the current selection bounds.

#### Scenario: Crop by tool
- **WHEN** the Crop tool's box is resized to a region and Enter is pressed
- **THEN** the document is resized to the region and its content is shifted so the region's top-left becomes the origin

#### Scenario: The default box is not a pending crop
- **WHEN** the Crop tool is chosen and its box is left canvas-sized
- **THEN** a crop box is shown, no crop is pending, and `Image > Crop` still crops to the selection

#### Scenario: Move, reset, and ratio lock
- **WHEN** the `crop_tool` self-test resizes the box by its bottom-right handle, drags inside it, presses Escape, and resizes with a 1:1 ratio set
- **THEN** the box resizes, moves by the drag, returns to the canvas, and stays square

#### Scenario: Delete Cropped Pixels
- **WHEN** a crop is committed with Delete Cropped Pixels on, and again with it off
- **THEN** with it on the layer is trimmed to the new canvas, and with it off the layer keeps its pixels beyond the canvas edge

#### Scenario: Crop by selection
- **WHEN** `Image > Crop` is invoked with an active selection
- **THEN** the document is cropped to the selection bounds

#### Scenario: Crop without a region
- **WHEN** crop is committed with no pending region and no selection
- **THEN** nothing changes

### Requirement: Eyedropper samples a colour
The system SHALL sample the composited colour at a canvas point, expose it as a
packed ARGB value, and record it as the frame's foreground colour.

#### Scenario: Sample a pixel
- **WHEN** the Eyedropper is clicked at a canvas point over an opaque red pixel
- **THEN** the sampled ARGB is opaque red and the frame's foreground colour becomes red

#### Scenario: Sample outside the document
- **WHEN** the Eyedropper is clicked outside the document bounds
- **THEN** sampling fails and the foreground colour is unchanged

### Requirement: Hand and Zoom tools

The system SHALL provide Hand and Zoom as first-class tools. Hand SHALL pan the
canvas on drag; Zoom SHALL magnify on click and reduce on modified click. The
canvas offset SHALL be clamped by one shared range helper at every mutation point
— pan, zoom anchoring, centre, fit, actual pixels, initial view, resize, and the
Navigator proxy — so that at least one display inch of 96 logical pixels of the
canvas remains visible on each axis whenever the document is larger than that
axis. The clamp SHALL slide each axis by the minimum needed rather than
recentering, and the canvas SHALL remain the single source of the offset.
**Zoom SHALL target the pointer: the Zoom tool's click SHALL anchor the zoom at
the clicked image point rather than the canvas centre, and the Navigator slider
SHALL anchor at the click/cursor point on the proxy, so the point under the
cursor stays fixed. The wheel SHALL apply one shared modifier precedence: a
horizontal side-wheel (`angleDelta().x() != 0`) SHALL pan horizontally; a
`Ctrl+Alt` vertical wheel SHALL pan vertically; an `Alt` (without `Ctrl`)
vertical wheel SHALL pan horizontally; otherwise the vertical wheel SHALL zoom
at the cursor, with `Shift` doubling the wheel zoom step.**

#### Scenario: Zoom in by click

- **WHEN** the Zoom tool is clicked on the canvas
- **THEN** the canvas magnification increases

#### Scenario: Zoom out by modified click

- **WHEN** the Zoom tool is clicked while a modifier is held
- **THEN** the canvas magnification decreases

#### Scenario: Zoom click targets the cursor [lct_zoom_cursor]

- **WHEN** the Zoom tool clicks a point away from the canvas centre
- **THEN** the zoom is anchored at that point so it stays under the cursor rather
  than the view zooming about the centre

#### Scenario: Shift doubles the wheel step [lct_wheel_shift]

- **WHEN** the vertical wheel is scrolled with Shift held
- **THEN** the zoom step is twice the unmodified step, still anchored at the
  cursor

#### Scenario: Alt pans horizontally [lct_wheel_alt_pan]

- **WHEN** the vertical wheel is scrolled with Alt held (without Ctrl)
- **THEN** the canvas pans horizontally and does not zoom

#### Scenario: Ctrl+Alt pans vertically [lct_wheel_ctrl_alt_pan]

- **WHEN** the vertical wheel is scrolled with Ctrl+Alt held
- **THEN** the canvas pans vertically and does not zoom

#### Scenario: A side-wheel pans horizontally [lct_wheel_side_pan]

- **WHEN** a horizontal side-wheel event arrives
- **THEN** the canvas pans horizontally and does not zoom

#### Scenario: Panning cannot push the canvas fully off-screen [lct_pan_margin]

- **WHEN** the canvas is panned in any direction past the reveal margin
- **THEN** the offset is clamped so at least 96 logical pixels of the canvas stay
  visible on that axis and the canvas does not jump to the other side

#### Scenario: Zoom anchoring is clamped [lct_zoom_clamp]

- **WHEN** a zoom-out at a corner would place the canvas outside the reveal margin
- **THEN** the resulting offset is clamped by the same shared range helper

#### Scenario: Fit and centre remain fully visible [lct_fit_within]

- **WHEN** Fit on Screen or centre is applied
- **THEN** the resulting offset is inside the shared range and the canvas is not
  pushed off-screen

### Requirement: Space temporarily activates Hand panning

Holding the `Space` key over the canvas SHALL temporarily enable Hand panning
while the previous tool remains logically active: the cursor SHALL become
`Qt::OpenHand`, and pressing and dragging SHALL pan the canvas through the shared
range helper exactly as the Hand tool does. Releasing `Space` SHALL restore the
previous tool's cursor and pan state, so a Space pan does not change the active
tool, the tool's options, or any document state. The `Space` key SHALL NOT be
bound as a prefix of a key sequence, so it is delivered as a plain key and never
consumed waiting for a second key.

#### Scenario: Space pans without changing the tool [lct_space_pan]

- **WHEN** `Space` is held and the canvas is dragged with a non-Hand tool active
- **THEN** the canvas pans, the active tool is unchanged, and the offset is
  clamped by the shared range

#### Scenario: Releasing Space restores the cursor [lct_space_release]

- **WHEN** `Space` is released after a pan
- **THEN** the previous tool's cursor and pan state are restored

#### Scenario: Space is not a sequence prefix [lct_space_not_prefix]

- **WHEN** `Space` is pressed and released on its own
- **THEN** it is handled as the temporary pan key and is not held waiting for a
  second key in a sequence

### Requirement: Keyboard nudge of the active layer

With the Move tool active, a plain arrow key SHALL translate the active layer by
1 document pixel on that axis and `Shift+Arrow` SHALL translate it by 10 pixels,
through the existing `translate_layer` path, recording one history state per
nudge and refreshing the display. The nudge SHALL be refused, leaving the
document unchanged with no history state, for a position-locked layer, a
Background layer, a group or adjustment layer, or when there is no active
document or active layer. The nudge SHALL use the same translate path the mouse
drag uses so the two cannot disagree; no separate nudge handler exists today and
none may be added that bypasses `translate_layer`.

#### Scenario: Plain arrow nudges one pixel [lct_nudge_one]

- **WHEN** the Move tool is active with a translatable active layer and an arrow
  key is pressed
- **THEN** the layer translates by one pixel on that axis and one history state
  is recorded

#### Scenario: Shift arrow nudges ten pixels [lct_nudge_ten]

- **WHEN** `Shift+Arrow` is pressed with the Move tool active
- **THEN** the layer translates by ten pixels on that axis

#### Scenario: A refused nudge changes nothing [lct_nudge_refused]

- **WHEN** an arrow key is pressed on a position-locked, Background, group, or
  adjustment layer, or with no active layer
- **THEN** the document is unchanged and no history state is recorded

### Requirement: Alt-drag duplicates the active layer

Holding Alt while the Move tool drags a whole layer (no active selection) SHALL
duplicate the layer, preview the duplicate moving under the cursor during the
drag, and make the duplicate the active layer on commit, leaving the source layer
in place. The bridge SHALL expose a `begin_move_duplicate` that duplicates the
active layer, recomposites, and builds the move preview without recording
history; the drag SHALL record exactly one undo state on `commit_move`. With an
active selection the behaviour is the selected-pixel duplicate of the
`selection-content-move` capability, not a whole-layer clone.

#### Scenario: Alt-drag clones the layer [lct_alt_clone]

- **WHEN** the Move tool drags a whole layer with Alt held
- **THEN** a duplicate layer is created and moves with the drag, the source layer
  keeps its pixels, and one history state is recorded on release

#### Scenario: The clone becomes active [lct_alt_clone_active]

- **WHEN** the Alt-drag is released
- **THEN** the duplicate is the active layer and the source remains in the stack

#### Scenario: No record during the drag [lct_alt_clone_record]

- **WHEN** `begin_move_duplicate` runs at press
- **THEN** no history state is recorded until the drag commits, which records
  exactly one

### Requirement: Alt press without movement does not duplicate

A Move-tool press with Alt held that does not move the pointer SHALL leave the
document unchanged: no duplicate layer and no history state. The duplicate SHALL
only come into existence once the pointer has actually moved, or SHALL be rolled
back on a zero-offset release. A non-zero Alt drag SHALL continue to insert the
clone, preview it, and commit one state with the clone active.

#### Scenario: A bare Alt click leaves no layer [mv_alt_zero_noop]

- **WHEN** the Move tool is pressed with Alt held and released at the same point
  without moving
- **THEN** no layer is added, the active layer is unchanged, and no history state
  is recorded

#### Scenario: The first movement creates the clone [mv_alt_first_move]

- **WHEN** an Alt Move press is followed by pointer movement before release
- **THEN** the clone is inserted and previewed, and release commits one state
  with the clone active
