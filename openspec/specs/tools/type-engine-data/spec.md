# type-engine-data Specification

## Purpose
Decodes EngineData into a typed tree and exposes the font set and first-run style through TypeTool.

## Requirements

### Requirement: EngineData decodes into a typed tree

`pictura-codec` SHALL parse an EngineData byte stream into a typed tree of
dicts, lists, integers, doubles, booleans, and strings, using bounded token,
depth, and byte caps. A malformed, truncated, or over-cap stream SHALL return a
typed error and MUST NOT panic. The parser SHALL decode parenthesised strings as
UTF-16BE when they begin with the `\xfe\xff` byte-order mark, applying the
`\(`, `\)`, and `\\` escapes, and SHALL decode property names as MacRoman.

#### Scenario: A typed tree round-trips through the parser

- **WHEN** a stream with a dict containing a list, a double, an integer, a boolean, and a string is parsed
- **THEN** the tree exposes each value with its type and key

#### Scenario: A malformed stream errors without panicking

- **WHEN** the parser is given a truncated or depth-overflowing stream
- **THEN** it returns an error and does not panic

### Requirement: TypeTool exposes the font set and first-run style

`read_psd` SHALL fill `TypeTool.fonts` with the embedded source's font-set names
and `TypeTool.style` with the first style run's effective character attributes —
font name, font style, size, leading including its auto flag, tracking, kerning
mode and value, horizontal scale, vertical scale, baseline shift, anti-aliasing
method, fill colour, and the character toggles — resolved against the
paragraph/style defaults when a run omits a field. It SHALL expose the first
paragraph run's effective paragraph attributes — alignment, justification,
word/letter spacing and glyph scaling, indents, space before/after, hanging
punctuation, hyphenation, and composer — resolved the same way. The
anti-aliasing method SHALL come from the text descriptor's `AntA` enum when it is
present, falling back to the EngineData `/AntiAlias` flag. When the `Txt `
descriptor has no EngineData, or the EngineData cannot be parsed, the style SHALL
be `None`, the font list empty, and the document read SHALL still succeed with
the `Txt ` string and raw descriptor bytes preserved.

#### Scenario: A real text layer exposes its font and size

- **WHEN** the fixture whose first style run sets `FontSize` 150 and defaults to font index 1 is read
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` reports the font name at index 1, size 150, and the run's fill colour

#### Scenario: A run omitting a character attribute resolves to the sheet default

- **WHEN** the first style run omits `Tracking` and the style sheet sets it to 40
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` reports tracking 40

#### Scenario: A run omitting a paragraph attribute resolves to the paragraph default

- **WHEN** the first paragraph run omits `SpaceAfter` and the paragraph sheet sets it to 12
- **THEN** `TypeTool`'s paragraph attributes report space after 12

#### Scenario: The anti-aliasing method is reported from the descriptor

- **WHEN** the fixture's text descriptor `AntA` names the Crisp method
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` reports anti-aliasing Crisp

#### Scenario: The EngineData flag is the anti-aliasing fallback

- **WHEN** the text descriptor has no `AntA` and the EngineData `/AntiAlias` flag is set
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` reports anti-aliasing Sharp

#### Scenario: A missing EngineData leaves the style unset

- **WHEN** a `TySh` block's `Txt ` descriptor has no `EngineData` value
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` is `None` and the document read succeeds

#### Scenario: A malformed EngineData does not fail the document

- **WHEN** the `EngineData` value is not parseable
- **THEN** `TypeTool.style` is `None` and the layer still reads with its text and raw `TySh` bytes
