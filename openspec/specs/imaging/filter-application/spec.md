# filter-application Specification

## Purpose
The destructive filter entry point: colour-channel extraction, mask-confined writes, and alpha-preserving output.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Destructive filter application entry point

`pictura-render` SHALL expose `pub fn apply_filter(layer: &mut pictura_core::Layer, filter: &pictura_filters::Filter, mask: Option<&pictura_core::LayerMask>) -> Result<(), pictura_filters::FilterError>`. It SHALL apply `filter` destructively to the layer's color channels and gate the write by the optional document-coordinate `mask`. When `layer.rect.width()` or `layer.rect.height()` is `<= 0` it MUST return `Ok(())` without modifying the layer. When the layer's lock state includes the pixel lock, it MUST return a refusal error without modifying the layer.

#### Scenario: A non-empty layer is filtered in place

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` is called on a layer with a non-empty `rect` and a valid filter
- **THEN** the layer's color channels are rewritten in place and `Ok(())` is returned

#### Scenario: A degenerate rect is a no-op

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` is called on a layer whose `rect` has zero or negative width or height
- **THEN** it returns `Ok(())` and the layer is bit-identical to its input

#### Scenario: A pixel-locked layer is refused [lfa_pixel_locked]

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` is called on a layer whose lock state includes the pixel lock
- **THEN** it returns a refusal error and the layer's channels are bit-identical to their input

### Requirement: Color-channel extraction and validation

The function SHALL extract the layer's color channels with ids `0`, `1`, and `2`, in that order, into a planar 8-bit `PixelBuffer` of `rect.width() × rect.height()` with 3 channels. A missing color channel, or a color channel whose `data.len()` is not `rect.width() * rect.height()`, MUST return `FilterError::InvalidParams` and MUST NOT panic. Filter-level validation errors MUST propagate to the caller unchanged, and no error path may partially write the layer.

#### Scenario: Missing color channel errors

- **WHEN** the layer has no channel with id `1`
- **THEN** `apply_filter` returns `FilterError::InvalidParams` and does not panic

#### Scenario: Wrong channel length errors

- **WHEN** a color channel's `data.len()` is not `rect.width() * rect.height()`
- **THEN** `apply_filter` returns `FilterError::InvalidParams` and the layer is unchanged

#### Scenario: Filter parameter errors propagate

- **WHEN** the filter rejects its own parameters (for example a negative Gaussian radius)
- **THEN** `apply_filter` returns that filter's `FilterError` and the layer is unchanged

### Requirement: Mask-confined write

For each local pixel `(lx, ly)`, the coverage SHALL be the mask value at document coordinates `(rect.left + lx, rect.top + ly)`, or `mask.default_color` when that point lies outside the mask rect; when `mask` is `None` the coverage SHALL be `255`. The function SHALL write `round(orig + (filtered - orig) * coverage / 255)` into color channels `0`, `1`, and `2`, where `orig` is the pre-filter sample and `filtered` the filter's output. Coverage `255` MUST reproduce the filter output, coverage `0` MUST leave the pixel unchanged, and intermediate coverage MUST interpolate.

#### Scenario: No mask filters the full frame

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` is called with `mask` `None`
- **THEN** every pixel receives the filter output as if coverage were 255

#### Scenario: Full coverage equals the filter output

- **WHEN** every pixel under the layer rect has mask coverage 255
- **THEN** the written pixels equal the filter output

#### Scenario: Zero coverage leaves the pixel unchanged

- **WHEN** a pixel under the layer rect has mask coverage 0
- **THEN** that pixel is bit-identical to its pre-filter value

#### Scenario: Partial coverage interpolates

- **WHEN** a pixel has mask coverage between 1 and 254
- **THEN** the written sample is the rounded linear interpolation of `orig` and `filtered` by `coverage / 255`

#### Scenario: Outside the mask rect uses the default color

- **WHEN** the layer rect extends beyond the mask rect
- **THEN** pixels outside the mask rect use `mask.default_color` as their coverage

### Requirement: Alpha and layer metadata preservation

The transparency channel (`id == -1`) MUST NOT be modified. `apply_filter` MUST NOT change `layer.rect`, `layer.mask`, `layer.opacity`, or `layer.blend`.

#### Scenario: Transparency is bit-identical

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` runs on a layer that carries a channel with id `-1`
- **THEN** that channel's data equals the input bit for bit

#### Scenario: Layer metadata is unchanged

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` returns success
- **THEN** `rect`, `mask`, `opacity`, and `blend` equal their pre-call values

### Requirement: Errors instead of panics on bad layer data

`apply_filter` MUST return a `pictura_filters::FilterError` — never panic — for any malformed layer color data, and MUST leave the layer unchanged on every error path.

#### Scenario: Malformed layer data returns an error without panicking

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` receives a layer with a missing or wrong-length color channel
- **THEN** it returns a `FilterError` and does not panic

#### Scenario: The layer is unchanged after an error

- **WHEN** `apply_filter` returns an error
- **THEN** every channel of the layer is bit-identical to its input

### Requirement: Filter application targets the active layer

The application-level filter entry point SHALL apply a filter to the active
layer, where the active layer is the exactly-one layer resolved by the shared
active-layer resolver, rather than defaulting to the topmost raster layer. When
no layer is active or more than one layer is selected, the application SHALL
refuse the filter and leave the document unchanged with no history state. The
refusal SHALL be surfaced to the user.

#### Scenario: A filter applies to the active layer [lfa_active_layer]

- **WHEN** a filter is applied with exactly one layer active
- **THEN** that layer is filtered and the other layers are unchanged

#### Scenario: No single active layer refuses [lfa_no_active_layer]

- **WHEN** a filter is applied with no layer active or with more than one layer
  selected
- **THEN** the filter is refused, no layer is mutated, and the document is
  unchanged

### Requirement: Filter respects the transparency lock per pixel

When the active layer's lock state includes `TRANSPARENCY`, a filter SHALL change
only the color channels of pixels whose pre-existing alpha is greater than zero
and SHALL write each such pixel's pre-existing alpha back unchanged; a pixel whose
alpha is zero SHALL be left untouched. The filter SHALL NOT lower any pixel's
alpha, and applying it SHALL leave every pixel's alpha value equal to its
pre-filter value.

#### Scenario: Filtering a transparency-locked layer keeps alpha [lfa_transparency_alpha]

- **WHEN** a filter runs on a transparency-locked layer
- **THEN** the color channels change where alpha is greater than zero and every
  pixel's alpha equals its pre-filter value

#### Scenario: Fully transparent pixels are untouched [lfa_transparency_clear_pixel]

- **WHEN** a filter runs on a transparency-locked layer at a pixel whose alpha is
  zero
- **THEN** that pixel's color and alpha are unchanged
