# color-settings Specification

## Purpose
The incoming-profile policy that decides how an embedded profile is honoured on open, and its Color Settings UI.
## Requirements
### Requirement: An incoming-profile policy decides how an embedded profile is honoured on open

`pictura-color` SHALL expose `Policy { Off, Preserve, Convert }` for an opened
RGB document's embedded ICC profile, defaulting to `Preserve`. The policy SHALL
be an application preference, not a document or history state. `pictura-codec`
SHALL expose `read_psd_with(bytes: &[u8], policy: Policy) -> Result<Document,
PsdError>` that applies the policy when the document is RGB and its image
resources carry a resource `1039` that parses as a non-sRGB ICC profile:

- `Preserve` SHALL leave the composite and every layer's pixel bytes unchanged,
  SHALL keep resource `1039`, and SHALL set `Document.document_icc` to the
  embedded profile bytes so the display converts it to the sRGB working space.
- `Convert` SHALL convert the composite and every layer's color channels to sRGB
  with relative-colorimetric intent, record the embedded bytes in
  `Document.source_icc`, remove resource `1039`, and leave `document_icc` `None`.
- `Off` SHALL leave the pixel bytes unchanged, remove resource `1039`, and leave
  the document untagged (`document_icc` and `source_icc` both `None`).

A document that is not RGB, has no profile, carries an sRGB profile, or carries
an undecodable profile SHALL be unchanged under every policy. `read_psd(bytes)`
SHALL remain equivalent to `read_psd_with(bytes, Policy::Convert)` for callers
that do not supply a policy.

#### Scenario: Preserve keeps the embedded profile and its pixels

- **WHEN** an RGB file with a non-sRGB ICC profile is read with `Policy::Preserve`
- **THEN** the composite and layer pixels are byte-identical to the file's, resource `1039` still holds the embedded bytes, and `document_icc` is the embedded profile

#### Scenario: Convert matches the existing normalisation

- **WHEN** the same file is read with `Policy::Convert`
- **THEN** the pixels are the sRGB conversion (within one LSB of lcms2), resource `1039` is removed, `source_icc` holds the embedded bytes, and `document_icc` is `None`

#### Scenario: Off ignores the profile

- **WHEN** the same file is read with `Policy::Off`
- **THEN** the pixels are byte-identical to the file's, resource `1039` is removed, and the document is untagged

#### Scenario: A profile-less or sRGB file is unchanged

- **WHEN** a file with no profile or an sRGB profile is read under any policy
- **THEN** the pixels and resources are unchanged and `document_icc` is `None`

#### Scenario: A Grayscale file is unchanged

- **WHEN** a Grayscale file with a non-sRGB profile is read under any policy
- **THEN** the pixels and resources are unchanged

### Requirement: The policy is persisted and applied when the application opens a file

The application SHALL persist the RGB incoming-profile policy as an application
preference, default it to `Preserve`, and pass it to `read_psd_with` when it
opens a document, so an open honours the configured policy. Changing it SHALL NOT
create a history state.

#### Scenario: The default policy is Preserve

- **WHEN** the application is started with no stored preference
- **THEN** the reported incoming policy is Preserve

#### Scenario: A stored policy survives a restart

- **WHEN** the policy is set to Convert and the session is saved and reloaded
- **THEN** the reported incoming policy is Convert

#### Scenario: Opening uses the configured policy

- **WHEN** the policy is Preserve and a file with a non-sRGB embedded profile is opened
- **THEN** the opened document keeps the embedded profile (`document_icc` is set) rather than being converted

### Requirement: Color Settings exposes the incoming policy

The application SHALL enable `Edit > Color Settings…` whenever the application
is running and SHALL open a dialog that shows the RGB working space (sRGB) and
lets the user choose the incoming-profile policy (`Off` / `Preserve Embedded
Profiles` / `Convert to Working RGB`), defaulting to the stored value. On OK the
choice SHALL be persisted; on Cancel it SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: The dialog edits the policy

- **WHEN** Color Settings is opened, the policy is changed to Off, and the dialog is accepted
- **THEN** the reported incoming policy is Off and the working space reads sRGB

#### Scenario: Cancelling changes nothing

- **WHEN** the policy is changed in the dialog and the dialog is rejected
- **THEN** the reported incoming policy is unchanged
