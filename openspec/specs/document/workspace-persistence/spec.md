# workspace-persistence Specification

## Purpose
Panel docks registered by name, layout and session persistence across restart, and per-column width modes.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Panels registered as named docks

The system SHALL host each right-hand panel as a plain `QWidget` content widget
with a unique, stable `objectName`, registered in the frame's panel registry
before any layout is saved or restored. The Tools panel and the options bar SHALL
remain `QDockWidget`/toolbar docks outside the column. Registration SHALL reject
a duplicate `objectName`.

#### Scenario: Panel registration assigns a stable name

- **WHEN** a panel content widget is created
- **THEN** it has a unique `objectName` used by layout and registry persistence

#### Scenario: Duplicate names are rejected

- **WHEN** two panels are registered with the same `objectName`
- **THEN** registration fails rather than silently corrupting layout restore

#### Scenario: The Tools panel stays a dock

- **WHEN** the frame is built
- **THEN** the Tools panel remains a `QDockWidget` and the column panels do not

### Requirement: Layout persistence across restart
The system SHALL save the dock and toolbar layout with
`QMainWindow::saveState()` and restore it with `restoreState()` on startup, so
the frame arrangement survives a restart at the same scale factor. The session
SHALL also persist each panel column's width, and a stored width SHALL be applied
and measurable after restart. Every quit path — the window close control,
`File > Exit`, `Ctrl+Q`, and session logout — SHALL persist the session, not only
a window-close event that runs `closeEvent`.

#### Scenario: Layout round-trips
- **WHEN** the layout is changed, saved, and the application restarts
- **THEN** the dock arrangement is restored

#### Scenario: Unknown panel in saved layout
- **WHEN** a saved layout references a panel that no longer exists
- **THEN** restore ignores the unknown entry and keeps the remaining arrangement

#### Scenario: A quit path persists the session [lpr_quit_save]
- **WHEN** the application is quit through `File > Exit` or `Ctrl+Q` rather than
  the window close control
- **THEN** the session is saved before exit and the saved state is restored on
  the next launch

#### Scenario: A column width is applied after restart [lpr_width_restart]
- **WHEN** a panel column is resized, the application is quit, and it is
  relaunched
- **THEN** the column's width after launch equals the stored width, measured
  after the first layout, for every column and for a column that was left in
  iconic mode

### Requirement: Window panels toggle and hide-all
The system SHALL expose a `Window > Panels` entry that toggles each panel's
visibility, and SHALL hide and restore all panels with `Tab`. `Shift+Tab` SHALL
hide all panels except the Tools panel and options bar; until those exist it
SHALL behave as `Tab`.

#### Scenario: Toggle a panel from the Window menu
- **WHEN** the user selects a panel from `Window > Panels`
- **THEN** that panel's visibility toggles without producing a history state

#### Scenario: Tab hides all panels
- **WHEN** the user presses `Tab`
- **THEN** all panels are hidden, and pressing `Tab` again restores them

### Requirement: Session state store

The system SHALL persist the opaque dock layout, the interface brightness level,
and the panel-column state to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/kooka-pictura/state.json`, writing
atomically through a temporary file so a failed write never leaves a torn store.
The store SHALL carry a schema version, and at schema version 5 SHALL add
`panelRailMode`, `railWidth`, `autoCollapseIconic`, `autoShowHidden`, and the
per-group collapsed, minimized, order, and visibility state. At schema version 6
the system SHALL persist the per-column layout (each column's side and order
with its groups' order, visibility, minimized, and collapsed state nested per
column). At schema version 7 the system SHALL add a width to each per-column layout
entry, and SHALL seed a column's width from the legacy top-level `railWidth` when
a loaded store has no per-column width. At schema version 8 the system SHALL add a
`railMode` to each per-column layout entry, SHALL restore each column's own rail
mode, and SHALL seed a column's rail mode from the legacy top-level
`panelRailMode` when a loaded store has no per-column rail mode. A store that is
missing a field or older than the current version SHALL load the defaults, a store
with no per-column layout SHALL load a single right-hand column built from the
legacy per-group state, and unknown keys SHALL survive a load-then-write cycle.
The store SHALL be written on every quit path.

#### Scenario: Session state is restored on launch

- **WHEN** the application starts and a valid session state exists
- **THEN** the saved layout, brightness, and panel-column state are applied

#### Scenario: Missing session state

- **WHEN** no session state file exists
- **THEN** the application starts with the default layout and default brightness

#### Scenario: Corrupt session state

- **WHEN** the session state file cannot be parsed
- **THEN** the application starts with defaults and does not crash

#### Scenario: Atomic write

- **WHEN** the session state is saved
- **THEN** the store is written to a temporary file and renamed over the previous store

#### Scenario: An older store loads the panel-column defaults [m41_session]

- **WHEN** a schema-4 store with none of the version-5 fields is loaded
- **THEN** the panel-column mode is `normal`, auto-collapse and auto-show are
  off, and the existing keys are preserved

#### Scenario: The per-column layout round-trips [m43_session]

- **WHEN** a multi-column layout is saved and the store is reloaded
- **THEN** each column's side and order plus its groups' order, visibility,
  minimized state, collapsed state, and rail mode are restored

#### Scenario: A version-5 store loads a single right-hand column [m43_session]

- **WHEN** a schema-5 store with a top-level per-group state and no per-column
  layout is loaded
- **THEN** the workspace shows one right-hand column containing those groups and
  the existing keys are preserved

#### Scenario: A version-6 store loads a default column width [lpr_v7]

- **WHEN** a schema-6 store whose per-column entries carry no width is loaded
- **THEN** each column loads the default width and the legacy top-level
  `railWidth` seeds the primary column's width

#### Scenario: A version-7 store seeds the per-column rail mode [lpr_v8_railmode]

- **WHEN** a schema-7 store whose per-column entries carry no `railMode` is loaded
- **THEN** each column loads the legacy top-level `panelRailMode` as its mode

#### Scenario: A per-column rail mode is applied after restart [lpr_column_mode]

- **WHEN** a non-primary column's `normal`/`iconic` mode is changed, the
  application is quit, and it is relaunched
- **THEN** each column's mode after launch equals its stored mode, measured after
  the first layout

### Requirement: Panel width mode survives a restart for every column

Each panel column's rail mode (normal vs icon/label width) and its normal width SHALL
survive a save/restart, including the primary/leftmost column and including
a column that was flipped from icon mode to normal mode just before quitting. The
persisted normal width SHALL be the remembered normal width, not the transient
icon-strip width captured while a mode flip is still being applied. A persisted
or restored normal width SHALL be clamped to a sane range so a stale or oversized
stored value cannot expand a column across the workspace; an icon-width column
SHALL keep its own narrow strip width.

#### Scenario: Primary icon to normal survives a restart [wsp_primary_rail_restart]

- **WHEN** the primary column is in icon mode, flipped to normal mode, and the
  app is restarted
- **THEN** the column restores to normal mode at its remembered normal width

#### Scenario: Other columns keep their own mode [wsp_other_rail_restart]

- **WHEN** one column is normal and another is icon, and the app is restarted
- **THEN** each column restores its own mode and width

#### Scenario: An oversized stored width is clamped [wsp_width_clamped]

- **WHEN** a store carries a normal width larger than the maximum, or a column is
  flipped to normal just before saving
- **THEN** the persisted and restored width is clamped to the maximum, so the
  column never expands across the whole workspace, and an icon column stays at
  its strip width
