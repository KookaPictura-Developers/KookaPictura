# document-model Specification

## Purpose
The Document and its bottom-first layer tree, the M1 layer property set, and the BlendMode and serialization contracts.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Document holds a bottom-first layer tree

The `Document` SHALL expose a `layers` collection of `Layer` values whose first
element is the bottom layer and whose last element is the top layer, matching the
PSD `'Layr'` on-disk z-order. The codec SHALL NOT reverse this ordering on read
or on write.

#### Scenario: Two oracle layers read bottom-first

- **WHEN** `two_layers.psd` (authored by `psd-tools`) is read
- **THEN** `doc.layers` has length 2, `layers[0].name == "Red"` with bounds
  `(top=0, left=0, bottom=4, right=4)`, and `layers[1].name == "Blue"` with
  bounds `(top=4, left=4, bottom=8, right=8)`

#### Scenario: Order survives a write/read round trip

- **WHEN** a document whose layers are `[Red, Blue]` bottom-to-top is written and
  read back
- **THEN** the two layers appear in the same `[Red, Blue]` order

#### Scenario: Groups nest their children bottom-first

- **WHEN** `group.psd` is read
- **THEN** `layers[0]` is a group named `"Group A"` and its `children` are
  `["Inner Green", "Inner Yellow"]` in that order

### Requirement: Layers carry the M1 property set

Each `Layer` SHALL carry a name, signed bounds (`PsdRect`), opacity (`0..=255`),
blend mode, clipping flag, visibility flag, optional raster mask, a channel list,
and group children. Visibility SHALL be derived from layer flag bit 1; clipping
SHALL come from the layer record's dedicated clipping byte, not from a flags bit.

#### Scenario: Oracle layer properties

- **WHEN** `two_layers.psd` is read
- **THEN** the bottom layer has `blend == BlendMode::Normal` and `opacity == 255`

#### Scenario: Visibility and clipping are read from their own fields

- **WHEN** a layer record has the visibility flag bit set, or the clipping byte
  set
- **THEN** the resulting `Layer.visible` / `Layer.clipping` reflect those fields
  independently, and the `0x08` flag psd-tools writes on ordinary layers is not
  mistaken for clipping

### Requirement: BlendMode maps all 27 PSD keys

`BlendMode` SHALL provide the 27 blend modes Photoshop CS6 exposes for a layer,
each mapping to exactly one 4-byte PSD key, plus the group-only `PassThrough`
mapping to `pass`. `PassThrough` SHALL be excluded from the 27-entry layer-mode
list. Parsing an unknown 4-byte key SHALL return `None` rather than a fallback
mode.

#### Scenario: All 27 keys round-trip and are unique

- **WHEN** every mode in `BlendMode::LAYER_MODES` is converted to its PSD key and
  parsed back
- **THEN** each key parses to its original mode and all 27 keys are distinct

#### Scenario: Pass Through is group-only

- **WHEN** `PassThrough` is converted to a key and back
- **THEN** the key is `pass`, the round trip succeeds, and `PassThrough` is not a
  member of `BlendMode::LAYER_MODES`

#### Scenario: Unknown keys are rejected

- **WHEN** `BlendMode::from_psd_key` is called with an unrecognized key such as
  `zzzz` or `nrml`
- **THEN** it returns `None`

### Requirement: Per-layer channels identify color, transparency, and mask

Layer channel data SHALL be identified by the PSD channel IDs: `0, 1, 2…` for
color, `-1` for the transparency mask, `-2` for the user layer mask, and `-3`
for the real user mask. Each `Channel` SHALL hold a planar, row-major buffer
whose length is the pixel count of the owning rectangle.

#### Scenario: Transparency channel round-trips

- **WHEN** a pixel layer carrying color channels and a `-1` transparency channel
  is written and read back
- **THEN** the `-1` channel is present with the same decoded bytes

#### Scenario: Layer mask channel is exposed as mask data

- **WHEN** `masked.psd` is read
- **THEN** the `-2` channel is exposed as `LayerMask.data` with length 64
  (an 8×8 mask), not as a color channel

### Requirement: Raster layer masks

A raster layer mask SHALL carry mask bounds (`PsdRect`), a default color, a
disabled flag, the raw mask flags byte, and optional decoded data. The `-2`
channel SHALL be sized by the mask rectangle, which may differ from the layer
rectangle.

#### Scenario: Mask bounds and data from the oracle

- **WHEN** `masked.psd` is read
- **THEN** the mask exists with bounds `(0, 0, 8, 8)` and `data` of length 64

#### Scenario: Disabled mask flag round-trips

- **WHEN** a layer mask with `disabled == true` is written and read back
- **THEN** `mask.disabled` is still `true` and the mask data is unchanged

### Requirement: Signed geometry and big-endian serialization contract

All multi-byte integers written to or read from disk SHALL be big-endian.
Rectangle edges SHALL be signed `i32` and MAY lie outside the canvas; the codec
SHALL NOT clamp layer or mask bounds to the document.

#### Scenario: Off-canvas and offset bounds keep their size

- **WHEN** a `PsdRect` has negative or beyond-canvas edges, for example
  `(top=-10, left=-20, bottom=30, right=40)`
- **THEN** `width()` is `60` and `height()` is `40`, derived from the signed
  edges without clamping

#### Scenario: Multi-byte fields are big-endian on disk

- **WHEN** a document of known dimensions is written
- **THEN** the header's height and width fields are encoded big-endian, so an
  independent reader recovers the same dimensions
