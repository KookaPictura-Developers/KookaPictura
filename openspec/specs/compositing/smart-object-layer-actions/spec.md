# smart-object-layer-actions Specification

## Purpose
Convert to Smart Object, author embedded sources, preserve on save and load, and rasterize, each as one undo state.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Convert to Smart Object eligibility and refusal

The engine operation `pictura-render::convert_to_smart_object(doc, path)` SHALL
convert the layer at `path` only when it is a single raster pixel layer: the path
resolves, the layer is not a group, has no adjustment data, is not the Background
layer, has no existing smart object, and has a `rect` with positive width and
height. On any other target the operation SHALL return `false` and SHALL NOT
mutate the document.

#### Scenario: A raster pixel layer converts

- **WHEN** `convert_to_smart_object` is called on the path of a raster pixel layer that is not the Background and has no smart object
- **THEN** it returns `true` and the layer carries an embedded smart object

#### Scenario: A group is refused

- **WHEN** the target path resolves to a group layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An adjustment layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has adjustment data
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: The Background is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer is the Background layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An existing smart object is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer already has a smart object
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: A zero-size layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer's `rect` has zero width or zero height
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An unresolved path is refused

- **WHEN** `path` does not resolve to a layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: Embedded smart-object source authoring

On success the operation SHALL author an embedded source document and attach it
to the layer as `SmartObject { kind: Embedded, payload, filename, filetype,
creator }`. The source document SHALL use the document's color mode and bit
depth and the layer's `rect` as its size, SHALL contain a copy of the layer
translated so its top-left is `(0, 0)`, and SHALL carry a merged composite equal
to the layer's raster over that rect. The operation SHALL serialize the source
with `write_psd` and store the bytes as the payload, with `filename` equal to
`"<layer name>.psd"`, `filetype` `8BPB`, and `creator` `8BIM`. The payload SHALL
be non-empty and SHALL be a valid PSD that the codec resolves as an embedded
smart object.

#### Scenario: The payload is a valid embedded source

- **WHEN** a raster layer is converted and the stored payload is read with `read_psd`
- **THEN** the payload parses, its document size equals the layer's `rect`, and its merged composite equals the layer's raster

#### Scenario: SmartObject metadata is stamped

- **WHEN** the conversion succeeds
- **THEN** the layer's smart object reports kind `Embedded`, a non-empty payload, filename `"<layer name>.psd"`, `filetype` `8BPB`, and `creator` `8BIM`

#### Scenario: Same mode and depth

- **WHEN** a Grayscale 8-bit document's layer is converted
- **THEN** the embedded source document is Grayscale 8-bit and `write_psd` accepts it

### Requirement: The raster proxy and rendering are unchanged

The operation SHALL keep the layer's existing pixel channels as a raster proxy
and SHALL NOT change the layer's name, rect, blend, opacity, fill, mask, or
position. Because a layer with a proxy renders from the proxy, the document
composite after conversion SHALL equal the composite before conversion.

#### Scenario: Pixel channels survive

- **WHEN** a raster layer with color channels is converted
- **THEN** the layer's channels are byte-for-byte the same as before

#### Scenario: The composite is unchanged

- **WHEN** the service composite is compared before and after a successful conversion
- **THEN** the two composites are equal

#### Scenario: Rejected destinations are untouched beyond the refusal

- **WHEN** conversion is refused
- **THEN** the layer's channels, rect, name, and smart-object state are unchanged

### Requirement: Save and load preserve the converted object

A document containing a converted layer SHALL round-trip through `write_psd`
and `read_psd` with the smart object preserved as embedded and its payload
unchanged.

#### Scenario: Round-trip preserves the object

- **WHEN** a document with a converted layer is written and read back
- **THEN** the layer resolves as an embedded smart object with a non-empty payload whose bytes equal the written payload

#### Scenario: The proxy still round-trips

- **WHEN** a converted document is written and read back
- **THEN** the layer's pixel channels still resolve and the composite is unchanged

### Requirement: The app command records exactly one undo state

The application SHALL expose the command `Layer > Smart Objects > Convert to
Smart Object` with the stable id `LayerSmartObjectConvertTo`. The command SHALL
be enabled only when the current layer is convertible, SHALL invoke the engine
operation on success, clear the link sets, recomposite, and record exactly one
history state labelled `"Convert to Smart Object"`. A refusal SHALL record no
history state.

#### Scenario: Success records one state

- **WHEN** the command runs on a convertible current layer
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Convert to Smart Object"` is added and the layer reports a smart object

#### Scenario: Refusal records nothing

- **WHEN** the command runs on a group, an adjustment layer, the Background, or an existing smart object
- **THEN** the history count is unchanged and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: Enabled only when convertible

- **WHEN** the current layer is not convertible
- **THEN** the command is disabled and its availability predicate mutates nothing

### Requirement: Rasterize Smart Object eligibility and refusal

The engine operation `pictura-render::rasterize_smart_object(doc, path)` SHALL
resolve `path` and SHALL rasterize only when the target is a single
smart-object layer: the path resolves, the layer is not a group, has no
adjustment data, and `smart_object.is_some()`. On any other target the operation
SHALL return `false` and SHALL NOT mutate the document. When materialization
requires decoding the embedded payload (the layer has no color channel) and the
payload is empty or cannot be decoded, the operation SHALL also return `false`
with no mutation.

#### Scenario: A smart-object layer rasterizes

- **WHEN** `rasterize_smart_object` is called on the path of a non-group, non-adjustment layer carrying a smart object
- **THEN** it returns `true` and the layer no longer carries a smart object

#### Scenario: A group is refused

- **WHEN** the target path resolves to a group layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An adjustment layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has adjustment data
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has no smart object
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An unresolved path is refused

- **WHEN** `path` does not resolve to a layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An undecodable payload is refused

- **WHEN** the target is a channel-less smart-object layer whose embedded payload is empty or cannot be decoded
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: Rasterizing materializes the object content into layer channels

On success the operation SHALL materialize the object's rendered content into
the layer's pixel channels and SHALL set `layer.smart_object` to `None`. When
the layer already has a color channel (`id == 0`), that existing raster proxy IS
the content, so the operation SHALL leave every pixel channel byte-for-byte
unchanged and SHALL NOT decode the payload. When the layer has no color channel,
the operation SHALL decode the embedded payload through the existing
embedded-source render path, scale the decoded source into the layer's `rect`,
and write channels `0..mode.color_channels()` plus a `-1` alpha channel. The
operation SHALL NOT change the layer's name, `rect`, blend, opacity, fill, mask,
or position.

#### Scenario: A proxy is left unchanged

- **WHEN** a smart-object layer with a color channel is rasterized
- **THEN** the layer's pixel channels are byte-for-byte the same as before

#### Scenario: A source-only layer materializes from the payload

- **WHEN** a smart-object layer with no color channel but a decodable embedded payload is rasterized
- **THEN** the layer's color channels and `-1` alpha hold the decoded source scaled into the layer `rect`

#### Scenario: The smart object is cleared

- **WHEN** rasterizing succeeds
- **THEN** `layer.smart_object` is `None`

#### Scenario: Layout fields are untouched

- **WHEN** a layer is rasterized
- **THEN** its name, `rect`, blend, opacity, fill, mask, and position are unchanged

### Requirement: Rasterize drops the preserved smart-object blocks and linked record

On success the operation SHALL remove the layer's preserved config block
(`SoLd`/`SoLE`/`plLd`/`PlLd`) from `layer.extra_blocks` and SHALL remove the
matching document-level linked-source record from `Document.layer_section_extra`,
so that a subsequent save does not re-emit a smart object and does not carry an
orphan `lnk*` record. A re-save followed by a load SHALL resolve no smart object
on the rasterized layer.

#### Scenario: The config block is gone

- **WHEN** a layer that carried an `SoLd` config block is rasterized
- **THEN** no `SoLd`/`SoLE`/`plLd`/`PlLd` block remains in `layer.extra_blocks`

#### Scenario: The linked record is gone

- **WHEN** a rasterized document is saved
- **THEN** its preserved section carries no linked-source record for the rasterized layer

#### Scenario: Save then load resolves no smart object

- **WHEN** a rasterized document is written and read back
- **THEN** the layer has no smart object and the document carries no orphan `lnk*` record

### Requirement: Codec removes a linked-source record by uuid

The codec function `remove_linked_source(layer_section_extra, uuid) -> Option<Vec<u8>>` SHALL
walk the preserved top-level tagged blocks. For a `lnkD`/`lnk2`/`lnk3`/
`lnkE` block it SHALL parse the `u64`-length-prefixed record list, remove the
record(s) whose Pascal-string uuid equals `uuid`, rebuild that block with the
same key, a recomputed length, and even padding, and copy every other block
byte-for-byte. It SHALL return `Some(new_bytes)` when at least one record was
removed and `None` when nothing matched, leaving the caller's bytes untouched.
It SHALL never panic; a malformed block SHALL be copied verbatim.

#### Scenario: A matching record is removed

- **WHEN** a section holds a `lnk2` with two records and an unrelated block, and one record's uuid is removed
- **THEN** the call returns `Some`, the surviving record and the unrelated block are byte-preserved, and the removed uuid no longer appears

#### Scenario: A non-matching uuid returns none

- **WHEN** no record's uuid equals the requested uuid
- **THEN** the call returns `None`

#### Scenario: A malformed block does not panic

- **WHEN** a tagged block's record list is malformed
- **THEN** the call returns without panicking and leaves that block verbatim

### Requirement: The Rasterize Smart Object command records exactly one undo state

The application SHALL expose the command `Layer > Rasterize > Smart Object` with
the stable id `LayerRasterizeSmartObject`. The command SHALL be enabled only when
the current layer is a rasterizable smart-object layer, SHALL invoke the engine
operation on success, then clear the link sets, recomposite, and record exactly
one history state labelled `"Rasterize Smart Object"`. A refusal SHALL record no
history state.

#### Scenario: Success records one state

- **WHEN** the command runs on a rasterizable smart-object current layer
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Rasterize Smart Object"` is added and the layer no longer reports a smart object

#### Scenario: Refusal records nothing

- **WHEN** the command runs on a non-smart layer, a group, or an adjustment layer
- **THEN** the history count is unchanged and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: Enabled only for a rasterizable smart-object layer

- **WHEN** the current layer is not a rasterizable smart-object layer
- **THEN** the command is disabled and its availability predicate mutates nothing

### Requirement: Place Smart Object from a file

The engine operation `pictura-render::place_smart_object(doc, filename, bytes)` SHALL decode `bytes`
with `pictura_codec::read_psd` and SHALL return `None`
without mutating the document when `bytes` do not parse as a PSD/PSB document.
Its signature is `place_smart_object(doc: &mut Document, filename: &str, bytes:
&[u8]) -> Option<String>`. On success it SHALL append a new layer at the top of
the document, name it `filename`, and return the new layer's path using the same
path string convention as the other `layer_ops` (`"0"`, `"2/1"`, …). The
operation SHALL NOT change any existing layer or the document size.

#### Scenario: A PSD source is placed

- **WHEN** `place_smart_object` is called with the bytes of a valid PSD and a display name
- **THEN** it returns `Some(path)` for a new topmost layer and mutates no existing layer

#### Scenario: Malformed bytes are refused

- **WHEN** `place_smart_object` is called with bytes that are not a parseable PSD/PSB document
- **THEN** it returns `None` and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: A placed layer is channel-less, native-size, and renders from its embedded source

For a decoded source of size `w × h`, the appended layer MUST have `rect =
(0, 0, w, h)`, `visible` true, `BlendMode::Normal`, `opacity` 255, no pixel
channels, and `smart_object = Some(SmartObject { kind: Embedded, payload:
Some(bytes), filename, filetype: *b"8BPB", creator: *b"8BIM", .. })`. Because the
layer has no color channel, the compositor SHALL render it from its embedded
payload through the existing embedded-source path, and the composite SHALL show
the source content within the layer rect. A `write_psd` followed by `read_psd`
SHALL re-resolve the placed layer as an embedded smart object with an unchanged
payload.

#### Scenario: The layer geometry and metadata are stamped

- **WHEN** a source of size `w × h` is placed as `filename`
- **THEN** the new topmost layer is named `filename`, has `rect = (0, 0, w, h)`, is visible, Normal, opacity 255, has no pixel channels, and carries an `Embedded` smart object with `payload` equal to the source bytes, `filename`, `filetype` `8BPB`, and `creator` `8BIM`

#### Scenario: The composite shows the placed source

- **WHEN** a solid-colour PSD is placed into a document
- **THEN** `composite_rgba` shows the source colour within the placed layer's rect

#### Scenario: Save then load preserves the placed object

- **WHEN** a document with a placed layer is written with `write_psd` and read back
- **THEN** the layer resolves as an embedded smart object whose payload equals the written bytes

#### Scenario: Content beyond the canvas is clipped

- **WHEN** the placed source is larger than the document
- **THEN** the composite is bounded by the document and the overflowing content is not drawn

### Requirement: The Place Smart Object command records exactly one undo state

The application SHALL expose the command `File > Place…` with the stable id
`file.place`. The command SHALL open a file dialog offering an `Images (…)`
filter beside the existing Photoshop files filter (`*.psd *.psb`) and SHALL be
enabled only when a document is open. On a chosen path the command SHALL route a
`*.psd`/`*.psb` file through the bridge `place_smart_object(path) -> QString`
and every other supported raster image through the bridge `place_image(path) ->
QString` defined by the `image-import` capability; a PSD/PSB file MUST NOT be
routed through Qt. For a Photoshop file the bridge SHALL read the file, derive
the display name from its base name, and invoke the engine operation on the
current document. On success only, the invoked bridge SHALL clear the link sets,
recomposite, record exactly one history state labelled `"Place"`, and return the
new layer path. On refusal the bridge SHALL return an empty string, record no
history state, and leave the document unchanged. After a successful place the
application SHALL select the new layer and start a Free Transform session on it
as defined by the `free-transform` capability; cancelling that session SHALL
leave the placed layer where it landed and MUST NOT remove or roll back the
`"Place"` history state.

#### Scenario: Success records one state and returns the layer path

- **WHEN** the command runs with a valid PSD file and an open document
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Place"` is added, the layer count increases by one, and the bridge returns the new layer's path

#### Scenario: A raster image records one state and returns the layer path

- **WHEN** the command runs with a supported raster image and an open document
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Place"` is added, a new smart-object layer is appended, and the image-import bridge returns the new layer's path

#### Scenario: A successful place starts a transform session

- **WHEN** the command places a supported image and returns the new layer path
- **THEN** a Free Transform session begins on the new layer and the `"Place"` history state remains recorded

#### Scenario: Refusal records nothing

- **WHEN** the command runs with a malformed source file
- **THEN** the history count is unchanged, the document is unchanged, and the bridge returns an empty string

#### Scenario: Enabled only when a document is open

- **WHEN** no document is open
- **THEN** the command is disabled

### Requirement: Replace Smart Object Contents eligibility and refusal

The engine operation SHALL resolve `path` and SHALL replace the source only
when the target is a single replaceable smart-object layer: the path resolves,
the layer is not a group, has no adjustment data, and its `smart_object` is
`Embedded` with a payload. Its signature is
`pictura-render::replace_smart_object_contents(doc, path, filename, bytes) ->
bool`. The operation SHALL decode `bytes` with `pictura_codec::read_psd` and
SHALL refuse when they do not parse as a PSD/PSB document. On any refusal it
SHALL return `false` and SHALL NOT mutate the document.

#### Scenario: A replaceable smart-object layer replaces its contents

- **WHEN** `replace_smart_object_contents` is called on a non-group, non-adjustment layer whose smart object is embedded with a payload and `bytes` are a valid PSD/PSB document
- **THEN** it returns `true`

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has no smart object
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: A group is refused

- **WHEN** the target path resolves to a group layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An adjustment layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has adjustment data
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An embedded object without a payload is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer's smart object is `Embedded` but has no payload
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: Malformed bytes are refused

- **WHEN** the target is a replaceable smart object and `bytes` do not parse as a PSD/PSB document
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: An unresolved path is refused

- **WHEN** `path` does not resolve to a layer
- **THEN** the operation returns `false` and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: Replacing contents swaps only the embedded source and clears the proxy

On success the operation SHALL set the layer's `smart_object.payload` to the new
source `bytes`, set `filename` to the supplied name, set `filetype` to `8BPB`
and `creator` to `8BIM`, and clear the stored `uuid` to empty. It SHALL clear
the layer's pixel channels so the compositor renders the new source through the
existing embedded-source path scaled into the layer's existing `rect`. It SHALL
preserve the layer's transform/geometry and every other property: `rect`, name,
mask, blend, opacity, fill, color, and lock flags SHALL be unchanged. Only the
smart-object source and the pixel channels SHALL change.

#### Scenario: The source metadata is replaced

- **WHEN** a replaceable smart object is replaced with `bytes` and `filename`
- **THEN** its payload equals `bytes`, its filename equals `filename`, and its filetype/creator are `8BPB`/`8BIM`

#### Scenario: The stored uuid is cleared

- **WHEN** the replacement succeeds
- **THEN** the layer's smart object `uuid` is empty

#### Scenario: The proxy is cleared so the new source renders

- **WHEN** a proxy-backed smart object is replaced and the document is composited
- **THEN** the layer has no pixel channels and the compositor draws the new source scaled into the layer's rect

#### Scenario: Geometry and layout are untouched

- **WHEN** a smart object with a mask, a non-default blend, opacity, fill, color, and lock flags is replaced
- **THEN** its `rect`, name, mask, blend, opacity, fill, color, and lock flags are unchanged

### Requirement: Replace drops and re-authors the preserved blocks and linked record

On success the operation SHALL remove the layer's preserved config block
(`SoLd`/`SoLE`/`plLd`/`PlLd`) from `layer.extra_blocks` and, when the previous
`uuid` was non-empty, SHALL remove the matching document-level linked-source
record from `Document.layer_section_extra` via
`pictura_codec::remove_linked_source`. A subsequent `write_psd` followed by
`read_psd` SHALL resolve the layer as an embedded smart object whose payload is
the NEW source bytes, and the old uuid and old payload SHALL be absent from the
saved document.

#### Scenario: The config block is gone

- **WHEN** a layer that carried an `SoLd` config block is replaced
- **THEN** no `SoLd`/`SoLE`/`plLd`/`PlLd` block remains in `layer.extra_blocks`

#### Scenario: The old linked record is gone

- **WHEN** a replaced document is inspected
- **THEN** the old uuid no longer appears in `layer_section_extra`

#### Scenario: Save then load resolves the new source

- **WHEN** a replaced document is written and read back
- **THEN** the layer resolves as an embedded smart object whose payload equals the new source, not the old payload or uuid

### Requirement: The Replace Contents command records exactly one undo state

The application SHALL expose the command `Layer > Smart Objects > Replace
Contents…` with the stable id `LayerSmartObjectReplaceContents` and SHALL show a
file dialog filtered to Photoshop files (`*.psd *.psb`). The command SHALL be
enabled only when the current layer is a replaceable smart object. On a chosen
path the bridge `replace_smart_object_contents(path, file_path) -> bool` SHALL
read the file, derive the display name from its base name, and invoke the engine
operation on the current document. On success only, the bridge SHALL clear the
link sets, recomposite, and record exactly one history state labelled
`"Replace Contents"`. On refusal the bridge SHALL return `false`, record no
history state, and leave the document unchanged.

#### Scenario: Success records one state

- **WHEN** the command runs on a replaceable smart-object current layer with a valid PSD/PSB file
- **THEN** exactly one history state labelled `"Replace Contents"` is added and the layer's payload is the new source

#### Scenario: Refusal records nothing

- **WHEN** the command runs with a missing, unreadable, or malformed file, or on a non-replaceable layer
- **THEN** the history count is unchanged, the document is unchanged, and the bridge returns `false`

#### Scenario: Enabled only for a replaceable smart object

- **WHEN** the current layer is not a replaceable smart object
- **THEN** the command is disabled and its availability predicate mutates nothing

### Requirement: Open As Smart Object decodes a PSD/PSB source or refuses

The engine operation SHALL decode `bytes` with `pictura_codec::read_psd`; its
signature is `pictura-render::open_as_smart_object(filename: &str, bytes:
&[u8]) -> Option<Document>`. It SHALL return `None` when `bytes` do not parse as
a PSD/PSB document. On success it SHALL return `Some(doc)` where `doc` is a new
document holding the source as a smart object. The operation SHALL NOT mutate
any input.

#### Scenario: A PSD source opens

- **WHEN** `open_as_smart_object` is called with the bytes of a valid PSD/PSB document and a display name
- **THEN** it returns `Some(doc)`

#### Scenario: Malformed bytes are refused

- **WHEN** `open_as_smart_object` is called with bytes that are not a parseable PSD/PSB document
- **THEN** it returns `None`

### Requirement: An opened-as-smart-object document is new, source-sized, and holds one embedded layer

The returned document SHALL be built with `Document::new(src.width,
src.height, src.mode, src.depth)`, preserving the source's dimensions, color
mode, and bit depth. Its merged composite SHALL be set from the decoded source's
composite so the pre-render composite shows the source. It SHALL contain exactly
one layer, appended by the existing
`place_smart_object(&mut doc, filename, bytes)`: a topmost, channel-less,
native-size layer at `(0, 0)` carrying `SmartObject { kind: Embedded, payload:
Some(bytes), filename, filetype: 8BPB, creator: 8BIM, .. }`. Because the layer
has no color channel, the compositor SHALL render it from its embedded payload.

#### Scenario: Geometry, mode, and depth match the source

- **WHEN** a source of size `w × h` in a given color mode and bit depth is opened
- **THEN** the returned document has `width = w`, `height = h`, and the source's mode and depth

#### Scenario: Exactly one embedded smart-object layer

- **WHEN** a valid PSD/PSB source is opened
- **THEN** the returned document has exactly one layer, its `smart_object.kind` is `Embedded`, its payload equals the source `bytes`, and its name is the supplied display name

#### Scenario: The composite shows the source colour

- **WHEN** a solid-colour PSD is opened as a smart object and the document is composited
- **THEN** `composite_rgba` shows the source colour

### Requirement: The Open As Smart Object bridge opens an untitled document and records one undo state

The bridge `PictureView::open_as_smart_object(path: &QString) -> bool` SHALL
read `path`, derive the source display name from the file's base name, and call
the engine operation with those bytes. On success it SHALL store the composited
image and the document, reset the edit state, capture exactly one history state
labelled `"Open As Smart Object"`, and set the view's path to NONE so the new
document is untitled. It SHALL return `false` without mutating the view when the
file is missing, unreadable, or not a PSD/PSB document.

#### Scenario: Success stores one untitled document

- **WHEN** the bridge is called with a valid PSD/PSB file
- **THEN** it returns `true`, exactly one history state labelled `"Open As Smart Object"` is added, and the view holds one document with one smart-object layer

#### Scenario: A refused source mutates nothing

- **WHEN** the bridge is called with a missing, unreadable, or malformed file
- **THEN** it returns `false`, the current document is unchanged, and no history state is added

#### Scenario: The opened document is untitled so Save cannot overwrite the source

- **WHEN** a source file is opened as a smart object
- **THEN** the view's path is empty and the source file is left untouched

### Requirement: The Open As Smart Object command creates a new untitled tab

The application SHALL expose `File > Open As Smart Object…` with the stable id
`FileOpenAsSmartObject` (`"file.openAsSmartObject"`). The command SHALL open a
file dialog filtered to Photoshop files (`*.psd *.psb`) and SHALL be enabled
whenever the application is running, like File Open. On a chosen path it SHALL
mirror `PicturaMainWindow::openPath`: construct a new `PictureView`, call
`open_as_smart_object`, and on success call `addDocument(view, QString())` so a
new untitled tab is created. On refusal it SHALL discard the view and add no
tab.

#### Scenario: The dialog filters to PSD/PSB and needs no open document

- **WHEN** the command is available with no document open
- **THEN** it is enabled and opens a file dialog filtered to `*.psd *.psb`

#### Scenario: Success adds one untitled tab

- **WHEN** the command is dispatched with a valid PSD/PSB path
- **THEN** exactly one new tab is added and its document path is empty

#### Scenario: Refusal adds no tab

- **WHEN** the command is dispatched with a malformed source
- **THEN** no tab is added and the document count is unchanged

### Requirement: Export Smart Object Contents accessor reads the embedded payload

The engine function `pictura-render::smart_object_source_bytes` SHALL accept
`(doc: &Document, path: &str) -> Option<Vec<u8>>`, SHALL resolve `path`, and SHALL
return `Some(payload.clone())` only when the resolved layer is not a group, has no
adjustment data, and its `smart_object` is `Some` with a non-empty payload. On
any other target it SHALL return `None`. The function SHALL be a pure read and
SHALL NOT mutate the document.

#### Scenario: A smart-object layer yields its payload

- **WHEN** `smart_object_source_bytes` is called on the path of a non-group, non-adjustment layer carrying a non-empty embedded payload
- **THEN** it returns `Some(bytes)` where `bytes` equal that layer's payload

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer yields none

- **WHEN** the target layer has no smart object
- **THEN** the function returns `None`

#### Scenario: A group yields none

- **WHEN** the target path resolves to a group layer
- **THEN** the function returns `None`

#### Scenario: An adjustment layer yields none

- **WHEN** the target layer has adjustment data
- **THEN** the function returns `None`

#### Scenario: An empty payload yields none

- **WHEN** the target layer's smart object has no payload or an empty payload
- **THEN** the function returns `None`

#### Scenario: An unresolved path yields none

- **WHEN** `path` does not resolve to a layer
- **THEN** the function returns `None`

#### Scenario: The document is unchanged

- **WHEN** `smart_object_source_bytes` returns a payload and the document is compared with a pre-call clone
- **THEN** the two documents are equal

### Requirement: The Export Contents bridge writes the payload byte-for-byte

The bridge `PictureView::export_smart_object_contents` SHALL accept
`(path: &QString, dest: &QString) -> bool`, SHALL read the source bytes for
`path` through `smart_object_source_bytes`, and SHALL write them to `dest` with
`std::fs::write`, without transcoding, so the destination holds the payload
exactly as stored. It SHALL return `true` only when the write succeeds. A
`None` source or a write failure SHALL return `false` and SHALL produce no
side effects beyond the attempted write.

#### Scenario: A successful export writes the exact bytes

- **WHEN** the current layer is a smart object with a payload and `dest` is a writable path
- **THEN** the bridge returns `true` and the file at `dest` is byte-for-byte the layer's payload

#### Scenario: A missing payload writes nothing and returns false

- **WHEN** `path` resolves to a layer without a non-empty payload
- **THEN** the bridge returns `false` and no file is written

#### Scenario: A failed write returns false

- **WHEN** the payload is available but `dest` cannot be written
- **THEN** the bridge returns `false`

### Requirement: The Export Contents command records no history state

The application SHALL expose the command `Layer > Smart Objects > Export
Contents…` with the stable id `LayerSmartObjectExportContents`
(`"layer.smartObject.exportContents"`). The command SHALL be enabled only when
the current layer is a smart object with a non-empty payload. Its handler SHALL
show a save dialog with a `*.psd` default filter, call
`export_smart_object_contents` for the current layer and the chosen destination,
and report the result. Because export only reads the document, the command SHALL
record no history state, SHALL NOT clear the link sets, and SHALL NOT
recomposite.

#### Scenario: Enabled only for a smart object with a payload

- **WHEN** the current layer is a smart object with a non-empty payload
- **THEN** the command is enabled, and it is disabled when the current layer is a non-smart layer, a group, or an adjustment layer

#### Scenario: The command is registered with its stable id

- **WHEN** the command registry is built
- **THEN** `LayerSmartObjectExportContents` is registered as an implemented `Layer > Smart Objects > Export Contents…` command

#### Scenario: Exporting adds no history state and mutates nothing

- **WHEN** the command runs on a smart-object current layer and a destination is chosen
- **THEN** the destination file holds the payload, the history count is unchanged, and the document is unchanged

#### Scenario: A cancelled or failed export records nothing

- **WHEN** the save dialog is cancelled or the bridge returns `false`
- **THEN** no history state is added and the document is unchanged

### Requirement: Edit Contents eligibility and refusal

The picture view SHALL expose a read-only predicate
`layer_can_edit_smart_object_contents(path) -> bool`. It SHALL return `true`
exactly when the resolved target is a non-group, non-adjustment layer whose
`smart_object` is of kind `Embedded` and carries a non-empty payload AND
`pictura_codec::read_psd(payload)` parses that payload as a PSD/PSB document. It
SHALL return `false` for every other target, including a non-`Embedded` object
and a layer whose non-empty payload is not a parseable PSD/PSB (for example a
placed JPEG). The predicate SHALL be a pure read and SHALL NOT mutate the
document. When it returns `false` the Edit Contents command SHALL be disabled
and SHALL record no history state.

#### Scenario: A PSD/PSB source is editable

- **WHEN** `layer_can_edit_smart_object_contents` is called on a non-group, non-adjustment layer whose `Embedded` smart object has a payload that parses as a PSD/PSB document
- **THEN** it returns `true`

#### Scenario: A non-parsing source is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer carries a non-empty payload that does not parse with `read_psd` (a placed JPEG)
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false` and the command is disabled

#### Scenario: A non-embedded object is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer's smart object is not of kind `Embedded` (for example an external, alias, or unresolved record)
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false` and the command is disabled

#### Scenario: A non-smart layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer has no smart object
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false`

#### Scenario: A group or adjustment layer is refused

- **WHEN** the target path resolves to a group or a layer with adjustment data
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false`

#### Scenario: An empty payload is refused

- **WHEN** the target layer's smart object has no payload or an empty payload
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false`

#### Scenario: An unresolved path is refused

- **WHEN** `path` does not resolve to a layer
- **THEN** the predicate returns `false`

#### Scenario: The predicate mutates nothing

- **WHEN** the predicate is called on any target and the document is compared with a pre-call clone
- **THEN** the two documents are equal

### Requirement: The Edit Contents command opens the source as a new untitled editor document

The application SHALL expose `Layer > Smart Objects > Edit Contents` with the
stable id `LayerSmartObjectEditContents` (`"layer.smartObject.editContents"`).
The command SHALL be enabled only when
`layer_can_edit_smart_object_contents` returns `true` for the current layer. On
dispatch it SHALL export the target's embedded payload byte-for-byte to a
per-session temporary file, load that file into a new document as an ordinary
document (its own layers and composite), and add it through
`addDocument(editor, QString())` so a new untitled tab opens. The editor document
SHALL be the decoded source, NOT a document wrapping the source as a smart-object
layer, and the editor tab SHALL be untitled regardless of the temporary file's
path.

#### Scenario: The command is registered with its stable id

- **WHEN** the command registry is built
- **THEN** `LayerSmartObjectEditContents` is registered as an implemented `Layer > Smart Objects > Edit Contents` command

#### Scenario: Enabled only for an editable source

- **WHEN** the current layer is an editable smart object
- **THEN** the command is enabled, and it is disabled when the current layer is a non-smart layer, a group, an adjustment layer, a non-`Embedded` object, an object with an empty payload, or a payload that does not parse as PSD/PSB

#### Scenario: One new untitled editor tab opens

- **WHEN** the command runs on an editable smart-object layer
- **THEN** exactly one tab is added, its document path is empty, and it holds the decoded source content

#### Scenario: Opening records no state on the origin

- **WHEN** the command opens an editor
- **THEN** the origin document is unchanged and its history count is unchanged

#### Scenario: An ineligible target adds no tab

- **WHEN** the command is dispatched while the current layer is not editable
- **THEN** no tab is added, no history state is recorded, and no origin state changes

### Requirement: Saving an editor commits the source and records exactly one Edit Contents undo state

The bridge SHALL expose `commit_smart_object_edit(layer_path, file_path) ->
bool`. It SHALL apply the same engine operation as
`replace_smart_object_contents` (read `file_path`, decode it as a PSD/PSB
source, swap the origin layer's embedded source, clear its pixel proxy, and drop
the preserved config block and matching linked-source record) and, on success
only, SHALL clear the link sets, recomposite, and record exactly one history
state labelled `"Edit Contents"`. The existing
`replace_smart_object_contents` method SHALL keep its signature, behavior, and
`"Replace Contents"` label. Saving an editor tab SHALL be intercepted in the
application's Save path: it SHALL call `editor->save(temp_file)` then
`origin->commit_smart_object_edit(layer_path, temp_file)`, refresh, and return
success WITHOUT opening a Save dialog and WITHOUT writing any user-chosen file.
The editor tab SHALL remain open and SHALL be marked clean. On any refusal the
bridge SHALL return `false`, record no history state, and leave the origin
unchanged.

#### Scenario: Save commits and records one state

- **WHEN** an editor tab is saved after the document was edited
- **THEN** the origin layer's embedded payload is the edited source and exactly one history state labelled `"Edit Contents"` is added

#### Scenario: The origin recomposites to the edited source

- **WHEN** the committed origin is composited
- **THEN** the original layer paints the edited source scaled into its existing rect

#### Scenario: The editor stays open and clean

- **WHEN** saving an editor commits successfully
- **THEN** the editor tab stays open and reports no unsaved changes

#### Scenario: Save writes no user file and shows no dialog

- **WHEN** Save runs on a session editor
- **THEN** no Save dialog is shown, no user-chosen file is written, and the only file written is the session temporary file

#### Scenario: Refusal records nothing

- **WHEN** the edited document cannot be serialized or the commit is refused
- **THEN** the bridge returns `false`, the origin is unchanged, and its history count is unchanged

#### Scenario: Replace Contents still records its own label

- **WHEN** `replace_smart_object_contents` runs on a replaceable layer
- **THEN** it records exactly one `"Replace Contents"` state, unchanged from before

### Requirement: Discarding or closing an Edit Contents session leaves the origin unchanged

Closing an editor tab without saving SHALL leave the origin document unchanged
and SHALL record no history state. Closing an editor SHALL remove its session and
delete its temporary file. Closing the origin SHALL remove every session
targeting it and SHALL leave each orphaned editor open as an ordinary untitled
document; a later Save on an orphaned editor SHALL behave like Save As for an
untitled document and SHALL NOT write the deleted temporary file. Destroying the
window SHALL delete every session's temporary file.

#### Scenario: Closing the editor unsaved leaves the origin unchanged

- **WHEN** an editor tab is closed without saving
- **THEN** the origin document is unchanged and its history count is unchanged

#### Scenario: Closing the editor removes the session and its temp file

- **WHEN** an editor tab is closed
- **THEN** the session temporary file no longer exists and the session is dropped

#### Scenario: Closing the origin orphans the editor as untitled

- **WHEN** the origin document is closed while an editor for it is open
- **THEN** the editor tab stays open with an empty document path and no session

#### Scenario: An orphaned editor does not write the deleted temp file

- **WHEN** Save runs on an orphaned editor
- **THEN** it routes through Save As and no file is written to the deleted temporary path

#### Scenario: Window destruction cleans up temp files

- **WHEN** the main window is destroyed with live sessions
- **THEN** every session's temporary file is deleted
