# smart-object-rendering Specification

## Purpose
Renders embedded smart-object sources without a proxy, with proxy precedence, nearest-neighbour placement, and no-op fallback.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Embedded smart-object source renders without a proxy

The renderer SHALL decode, for a visible non-group non-adjustment layer whose
smart object is `Embedded` with a non-empty payload and no color channel (`id`
0), the payload as a document and composite the decoded pixels into the layer's
rect. The composite SHALL apply the layer's opacity, fill, mask, and blend mode
with the same semantics as a raster layer.

#### Scenario: Source renders in the layer rect
- **WHEN** a layer has an embedded payload and no color channel
- **THEN** the decoded source pixels composite inside the layer's rect instead of a black rectangle

#### Scenario: Layer properties apply
- **WHEN** such a layer has opacity, a mask, or a non-Normal blend mode
- **THEN** those properties modify the decoded source exactly as they would a raster layer

#### Scenario: Invisible layer is skipped
- **WHEN** such a layer is not visible
- **THEN** the payload is not decoded and the backdrop is unchanged

### Requirement: A raster proxy takes precedence over the embedded payload

A layer that has a color channel (`id` 0) SHALL render from its stored channel
data, and the renderer SHALL NOT decode the smart-object payload for that layer.
Existing files that carry a Photoshop raster proxy SHALL render unchanged.

#### Scenario: Proxy is used
- **WHEN** a smart-object layer also has a color channel
- **THEN** the channel data is composited and the payload is not decoded

#### Scenario: No behaviour change for proxied files
- **WHEN** a document whose smart-object layers all carry color channels is composited
- **THEN** the result equals the result before this change

### Requirement: An unusable source is a no-op

The renderer SHALL leave the backdrop unchanged, and SHALL NOT return an error or
panic, when a smart-object layer's source is `External`, `Alias`, or
`Unresolved`, when its payload is empty, or when the payload fails to decode.

#### Scenario: Non-embedded kind is a no-op
- **WHEN** a layer's smart object is external, alias, or unresolved
- **THEN** the composite leaves the backdrop unchanged and raises no error

#### Scenario: Empty payload is a no-op
- **WHEN** an embedded smart object has an empty payload
- **THEN** the composite leaves the backdrop unchanged and raises no error

#### Scenario: Undecodable payload is a no-op
- **WHEN** an embedded payload is not a decodable document
- **THEN** the composite leaves the backdrop unchanged and raises no error

### Requirement: Decoded source is placed by the layer rect with nearest-neighbour scaling

The renderer SHALL scale the decoded source into the layer's rect using
nearest-neighbour sampling, clamped to the canvas, and SHALL NOT apply the
`Trnf`/warp transform or bilinear resampling. The decoded document's stored
merged composite SHALL be preferred when it is usable; otherwise the renderer
SHALL composite the decoded document's layers to obtain the source.

#### Scenario: Scale into the rect
- **WHEN** the source size differs from the layer rect
- **THEN** each destination pixel samples the nearest source pixel

#### Scenario: Stored composite preferred
- **WHEN** the decoded document carries a usable stored merged composite
- **THEN** those pixels are used as the source

#### Scenario: Layers composited as fallback
- **WHEN** the decoded document has no usable stored merged composite
- **THEN** the decoded document's layers are composited to produce the source

#### Scenario: Transform is not applied
- **WHEN** an object carries a `Trnf`/warp transform
- **THEN** the source renders axis-aligned in the layer rect, without bilinear resampling

### Requirement: An authored embedded source composites its colour

The renderer SHALL composite a document authored in memory with a smart-object
layer whose embedded payload is a document of a known solid colour and whose
layer carries no color channel, yielding that colour across the layer's rect.

#### Scenario: Author and render
- **WHEN** a layer is authored with an embedded solid-colour source and no proxy
- **THEN** `composite_rgba` yields that colour inside the layer rect

#### Scenario: Authored source respects the rect
- **WHEN** the authored layer rect covers only part of the canvas
- **THEN** the colour appears only inside that rect and the rest of the canvas is unchanged
